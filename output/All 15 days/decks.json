        "success": "Summary\n\nAt its core you are a tempo-based aggressive deck centered around Secret Passage and void recursion. Your main objective is to try and connect with your infiltrate units (Teacher of Humility and Amaran Stinger) and push damage through stalled board states using Secret Passage and Heirloom Seeker or 'go wide' with Scorpion's and Xenan Obelisk.\n\nPledging: This deck has 16 pledge units (Heirloom Seeker, Cykalis, the Burning Sand, Dread, and Moonstone Vanguard) so you are able to turn one pledge fairly often. Unlike other pledge decks (i.e. Ixtun and TJP) you aren't a 'pledge or lose' deck. Your only pay off is Glasshopper and often the passive ability is good enough in an aggressive deck.\n\nUnit choices\n\nGlasshopper: This helps reduce the cost of your 16 pledge units and provide some card advantage. You can aggressively trade Glasshopper off and bring it back with Dark Return to retrigger its ability.\n\nHeirloom Seeker: A great fit for the deck. Adds to the evasion aspect and combos well with Xenan Obelisk. The deck has access to a lot of relics: Disciplinary Weights from Teacher of Humility, Secret Passage, Xenan Obelisk, Kerendon Merchant to get Secret Passage, recurring your Kerendon Merchant or Teacher of Humility from the void with Dark Return or Dread, and using Be Gone to retrigger Teacher of Humility or Kerendon Merchant.\n\nTeacher of Humility: One of the best units in the deck and is your preferred two drop. Use Secret Passage to force infiltrate and Be Gone or Vara's Choice to clear blockers out of the way. Don't be afraid to aggressively use Secret Passage's activated ability to permanently give Teacher of Humility unblockable as you can recur it later from the void with Dread and Dark Return and retrigger infiltrate. You can also use Be Gone to return Teacher of Humility to retrigger infiltrate.\n\nAmaran Stinger: Another great unit and part of your go-wide plan with Xenan Obelisk. It is a great target for Secret Passage in combination with void recursion. This deck triggers Amaran Stinger A LOT. It's not uncommon you trigger it 4-5 times in one game. Retrigger it using the various interactions of the deck (see Teacher of Humility's description).\n\nKerendon Merchant: This is the preferred merchant since it gives you access to more copies of two of your most important cards: Secret Passage and Dark Return. Can aggressively trade it off in combat to get back from the void for more market access.\n\nCykalis, the Burning Sand: A staple card in any aggressively-slanted time deck. Provides a pledge unit for Glasshopper. This is a huge threat and if it isn't removed you can often do 15 damage with in in conjunction with Secret Passage (first charge attack, Secret Passage's summon ability, and then Secret Passage's activation). A great target for Dark Return and extends the number of high-power charge units in your deck.\n\nDread: A key unit for the deck. Ideally, the play pattern you want to achieve using Dread is to play another unit (Teacher of Humility, Amaran Stinger, ect.), use Secret Passage's ability to give the unit unblockable and put it in the void, and then use up to six power to play Dredge (six power usually but cost can be reduced with Glasshopper), use Secret Passage's ability on it, and then recur the unit from the void with a permanent unblockable buff.\n\nOnce Dread is in the void and permanently given unblockable and you have drawn another Dread you can start chaining Dread by recurring them each turn to provide no less than an eight point life swing. You don't want Dread to be killed in combat so try and find windows to connect with it. You can also play Dread and not attack with it to use it as an expensive Dark Return.\n\nMoonstone Vanguard: One of the best remaining options for good pledge units. Powerful with Secret Passage to guarantee a card draw and also survive in combat. Great if given a permanent unblockable buff with Secret Passage as you keep drawing with no repercussions of it dying in combat. A good unit to ramp out with Glasshopper a turn early.\n\nAttachments:\n\nSecret Passage: This is the best card in the deck and most games you win involve using it many times. Helps push through stalled board states, allows you to easily gain value using Teacher of Humility and Amaran Stinger's infiltrate ability or Moonstone Vanguard's card draw, and its permanent unblockable activation is great while recurring units from the void. If your units get hit with Permafrost you can sacrifice them to Secret Passage.\n\nXenan Obelisk: This is part of your go-wide plan with Amaran Stinger. Works well with unblockable units to push through additional damage. Works great with Heirloom Seeker to push through no less than three damage.\n\nSpells\n\nBe Gone: This is an effective card in the deck. Helps with your fixing by providing shadow influence. Clears blockers out of the way for your infiltrate units and adds to the aggressive tempo plan with charge units. Against control decks with non-fast speed removal you can attack with your charge units and then protect them by returning them back to your hand (Cykalis, the Burning Sand being the best at this). Works well with Teacher of Humility and Amaran Stinger to retriggering infiltrate. Also works well with Secret Passage since you can active it to permanently give a unit unblockable, attack with the unit, and then return the unit to your hand before you have to sacrifice it at end of turn. With this in mind, Be Gone can function like additional copies of Dark Return.\n\nDark Return: Use on charge units by providing additional virtual copies of units with charge. Good in conjunction with Secret Passage after units have been given permanent unblockable buffs. Also great with the infiltrate units since you can retrigger infiltrate. The +1/+1 ability works well with an unblockable unit to push through additional damage. Use with Glasshopper to provide more copies of your pledged unit. Use with Kerendon Merchant to provide more access to your market.\n\nVara's Choice: Like Be Gone, Vara's Choice clears blockers out of the way for your infiltrate units and adds to the aggressive tempo plan with charge units. I also believe Vara's Choice is a well-positioned spell in the format since there are many Aegis units or other units you don't want to ever enter play along with their full card text.\n\nNote: In version 1.21 the remaining copy of Vara's Choice has been removed from the maindeck and a Banish has been put back in.\n\nDesecrate: The best removal spell from the new campaign. You can mitigate the three damage by gaining life by attacking with Dread, blocking with Moonstone Vanguard, and drawing Vara, Vengeance-Seeker from the market.\n\nBanish: A removal spell to round out the deck. I like Banish because it can interact with a lot of commonly played hate cards like Statuary Maiden, Adjudicator's Gavel, or Urn of Choking Embers. Also nice to have a main deck out to Avigraft in case your Kerendon Merchant gets hit and your market gets disabled.\n\nPowerbase\n\nThe powerbase is solid and you rarely have issues with influence requirements since you have so much fixing with your pledge units. Your main bottlenecks on influence are TT on turn two (for Teacher of Humility), SS on turn 2+ (for Desecrate), and to a lesser extent SS on turn 4 (for Dread). Often you don't want to cast Dread until after turn four anyways so this is not a strict requirement on shadow influence.\n\nBe Gone provides additional shadow influence. Although unscientific, the deck has access to 31 time influence and 31 shadow influence counting all the additional influence provided in addition to the 26 main deck power.\n\nMarket\n\nYou have additional copies of Secret Passage and Dark Return, a way to clear out a blocker out or stabilize with Desecrate, and Banish to interact with hate cards.\n\nVara, Vengeance-Seeker: Vara, Vengeance-Seeker helps shore up the aggressive matchups and interact a bit more with Aegis units. The lifesteal also helps if you are racing flying units in combat that you are unable to block. A great target for Secret Passage as you are gaining a steady stream of unblockable life. Great with Dark Return or Be Gone to retrigger the summon ability.\n\nStrengths and Weaknesses\n\nStrengths: Like Haunted Highway, this deck is fairly hard for the opponent to calculate how much damage they will be taking each turn due to the high number of charge or unblockable units, and cheap bounce effects. The powerbase is good and you have a proactive aggressive strategy that can punish slow removal and expensive tap out threats. You are great in board stalls due to the number of unblockable units. You are also strong against removal-based midrange decks that have slow removal like Desecrate or Harsh Rule. Rather than trying to use multiple spells to interact with Aegis units you can instead use unblockability to go around them.\n\nWeaknesses: This deck is weak to fast spell removal, silence effects, and transformation effects (i.e. Equivocate) since your goal is to stack additional skills onto units and bring them back from the void. I would imagine that Jennev Peaks would be a bad matchup but you may be able to maneuver around them once they tap out to play a large threat or have exhausted their fast speed removal. As with other aggressive strategies, your are weak to large lifesteal units like Vara, Vengeance-Seeker. You are also weak to fliers. Make sure prioritize you removal for lifesteal and flying units.\n\nVoid hate cards are very good against you so be aware and try and proactively answer them if you can.\n\nVersion 1.1 changes\n\nMainboard:\n-1 Xenan Obelisk\n-3 Vara's Choice\n-1 Crest of Mystery\n+1 Xenan Banner\n+3 Desecrate\n+1 Banish\n\nFour Xenan Obelisk were clunky so I have cut one copy. I am experimenting with Desecrate in place of Vara's Choice due to power level reasons but may return back to Vara's Choice. I have made a few changes to the power base to help smooth it out. Added another Banish in place of the Xenan Obelisk but not sold on this change (Might want Vara's Choice instead).\n\nNote on Be Gone: I believe that Be Gone is worth it and the shadow influence gains are even more relevant due to the new additions of Desecrate and Vara, Vengeance-Seeker from the market. Eliminating the ability to return your own units is a large aspect of this deck that I do not want to remove yet.\n\nMarket:\n-1 Vara's Choice\n-1 Xenan Banner\n+1 Desecrate\n+1 Vara, Vengeance-Seeker\n\nI like having access to one copy of Vara, Vengeance-Seeker to shore up some issues with aggressive decks and Aegis units. Xenan Banner has been cut because I wasn't accessing it that often.\n\nVersion 1.2 changes\n\nMainboard:\n-2 Banish\n-3 Crest of Mystery\n+1 Vara's Choice\n+2 Diplomatic Seal\n+2 Shadow Sigil\n\nI want undepleted power as much as possible so I've cut the Crest of Mystery entirely. Was feeling the loss of Xenan Banner in the market so I cut one piece of interaction for a 26th power. Banish was clunky so I've changed them to Vara's Choice.\n\nMarket:\nNo changes\n\nVersion 1.21 changes\n\nMainboard:\n-1 Vara's Choice\n-1 Diplomatic Seal\n+1 Banish\n+1 Crest of Mystery\n\nDid some find tuning of the powerbase by exchanging one copy of Diplomatic Seal for Crest of Mystery and added a copy of Banish in place of Vara's Choice to have another answer to hate cards.\n\nFuture directions and thoughts\n\nYou am still trying to fine tune the interactive spells and market choices. A card I am interested in trying is Madness since it combines well with Secret Passage and is a huge tempo swing.\n\nNote on 4/9/2019: I tried out a few common recommendations including three Vara, Vengeance-Seeker over Xenan Obelisk and two copies of Blackhall Warleader over Heirloom Seeker in the main deck. I was unimpressed and was losing more matches. I've gone back to v1.2 with no additional changes as of now. Desecrate has been great so I am happy with that inclusion.\n\nMatch History\n\nSince version 1.2 I have added my match history if you want to see the deck results."

I tweaked the list and went 9-1 at Top 100 Masters in the past few days. I don\u2019t have much time to play test this week unfortunately but so far it feels like a fun list.\n\nI really like the new card Ponysnatcher and wanted to find a way to make it work in a deck. Getting the 2 shadow influence on turn 2 is quite easy with this deck so it\u2019s usually not a problem to play it on curve. My main concern is limited card draw and not having market fodder for merchant. I was considering adding 2x Xo to fix that problem and would be interested in getting feedback. This is why there is 2x Dark Return to act as card draw / play back one of your big threats.\n\nI also didn\u2019t include Hojan in an empower list because I was tight on space and did not have enough Renown activators. I\u2019d rather play Lost Scroll to ramp or Ponysnatcher on 2. It could definitely fit the deck though.\n\nThe main spots I\u2019m not sure are 2x Regent\u2019s Tomb (it did win me a game vs camat0 by sabotaging his Grasping at Shadows) and 2x Makto (I feel like it was a good additional recurring threat although there is a lot of Equivocate/Silence right now). I\u2019m also not sold on market choices besides Chains and Vanquish).\n\nTelut has definitely been MVP and you can usually get to play him on curve. Always great vs all the Aegis out there. The only issue is that you can\u2019t attack Sites or his effect won\u2019t trigger which makes it awkward sometimes in this Site meta.\n\nI feel like Argenport has potential and would welcome your feedback and input on how to make this deck better.\n\nThanks!"

        "success": "I used this deck to make masters (Rank 60), and it has been performing quite well for me in the current metagame. Here's a breakdown of my card choices, as well as my reasoning for not including other options:\n\n3x Defiance: Critical for answering an early teacher of humility, and it has utility for locking down lethal charge units. However, it's quite bad against sites in general as it requires the unit to attack. Also bad against Sandstorm Titan and Moonstone Vanguard.\n\n1x Seek Power: Should probably be 2x, but I'm greedy. There are 2 reasons to play seek power over a regular sigil. First off, it fixes your influence. More importantly, due to the way mulligans work you have a smaller chance of ending up with a 2-sigil opening hand when you have non-sigil cards that fetch sigils for you, like seek power and privilege of rank.\n\n4x Strategize: One of your main card advantage spells. Usually just a draw 2 as you can get rid of extra Jotun Hurlers or useless sigils.\n\n3x Vanquish: Very efficient removal when it works. Sucks to have 2 of these in hand against a board of 3/2 aggro units.3-of is a safe spot to be in.\n\n4x Hailstorm: Amazing removal spell, one of the main reasons to be playing Hooru Control. This card will usually net you a 2-for-1 at least, and is good against any deck playing units (kills merchants at the very least).\n\n4x Jennev Merchant: Not the best merchant, but she does the job. I'll explain the market later.\n\n4x Privilege of Rank: The justice version of Wisdom of the Elders. Also has amazing synergy with Honor of Claws.\n\n4x Wisdom of the Elders: Instant 2-for-1. The backbone of any primal control deck.\n\n4x Auric Runehammer: Incredible card right now, the more the merrier. Also one of the only ways to answer Vargo.\n\n4x Honor of Claws: MOAR CARDS (Bear Voice).\n\n4x Harsh Rule: Do I need to explain this one?\n\n4x Jotun Hurler: Snowball is basically worth an entire card in the current metagame. They pop aegis, kill hojans, team up with hailstorm to kill vargo, etc. You also get to put away the 4/4 with cards like Jennev Merchant, Strategize, and Honor of Claws.\n\n2x End of the Story: Sweepers aren't at their best in the current metagame since so many decks are playing 4 copies of Palace. That said, sweepers are still very important for control decks. We also have extra board clears in the form of double Hailstorm, so 6 Harsh Rules works.\n\n2x Channel the Tempest: Not always necessary, since we already have tons of card draw with strat, wisdom, and honor. However, having a big finisher once in a while can be nice. Channel also deals with sites very well.\n\n3x Sword of the Sky King: Our main win-condition. Kills people dead. Nuff said.\n\nMarket:\n1x Vision of Austerity: Great for answering opposing runehammers. Also great against Rat Cage.\n1x Rain of Frogs: Pretty much an auto-include for most control markets. This card single-handedly answers palace. That's HUGE!\n1x Eilyn's Choice: Multipurpose fast speed removal and counterspell. Useful against Maul in particular.\n1x Eilyn, Clan Mother: Incredible win-con against decks that are low on removal (praxis). Is also a silence effect for cards like Scourge of Frosthome. All-around great card.\n1x Aid of the Hooru: Almost always castable in long games, and will win you the game on the spot.\n\n\nDiscarded Options:\n\nKorovyat Palace: Not a huge fan of this card in general. Any decently skilled player will just ignore it and continue to target your life total most of the time, at which point it's just an extremely slow wisdom. We don't have enough units for the rest of the site to be relevant reliably.\n\nThrone Warden: Fun card, but a little underpowered for my taste. You almost never get to curve runehammer into this.\n\nEilyn's Choice: Yes, we have a market copy, but there are no maindeck copies. The fact that it costs 1 more than vanquish and can only target an attacking unit makes it just worse, since you can't stop cards like Palace and Peak from going off.\n\nStormhalt Knife: Just not a great card. 5/5 weapon for 6 is a terrible rate, and even when it's free it's usually going to be about as good as a vanquish or defiance. It's just not worth the effort.\n\nBrilliant Idea: Good card in decks that can really lock down the game (Temporla Control). We're actually looking to kill the opponent once we get to 8, so Channel the Tempest does the job better for us.\n\nMartyr's Chains: Why would you play this over Sword of the Sky King? It has the same problem as palace, namely that we don't have any units for it to buff."

Don't feel like you have to pledge in this deck though- more so about maintaining a steady board and chipping away at your opponent.\n\nThis deck has a lot of different ways to win with Teacher, Cykalis, Moonstone (which is fantastic against aggro) and other cheap reach/tempo cards like Torch, Permafrost, Equivocate and Display of Instinct.\n\nMarket has Maul which people rarely expect along with Accelerated Evolution which can surprise opponents as well and get those minions to hit the face. Feel free to tinker with the Market as I typically only fetch Maul and Accelerated Evolution with the occasional spell negation. But often this deck is strong enough to win without much market play.\n\nCurrently only running the Seats for influence since curving out is usually much more important than scouting but have not tried experimenting with banners.\n\nThat's pretty much it- keep an eye out for board clears and lifesteal and you'll do just fine on that god-forsaken ladder."

        "success": "My (with some help from Rhike) take on Hooru Control post Homecoming. Below is a detailed description of why each card or card set was included.\n\nDraw Suite: This deck has a lot of card draw in the form of 4xWisdom of the Elders, 4xHonor of Claws, and 4xKorovyat Palace. This helps you dig for Chains, removal, and power. Privilege of Rank is also a pseudo card draw spell, always drawing you power so you can hit your power drops (and kill stuff with Chains). Combos well with HoC too.\n\nRemoval Suite (aggro): 4xDefiance, 3xSnowball, and 2xHailstorm +1 in market. The deck lacks any form of healing so dealing with aggro units as quickly as possible is important.\n\nRemoval Suite (midrange): 4xVanquish, 4xHarsh Rule, and 2xAuric Runehammer. You can also contest the board vs midrange with your various units.\n\nUnits:\n4xJennev Merchant allows for 3+1 Palace plus has built in aegis helping it stick to the board to protect Palace.\n4xValkyrie Enforcer is a solid utility minion that generates instant value when played. Mid to late game he's a random unit (well not random, he has flying which is useful evasion) to heap palace buffs upon.\n4xSvetya, Orene of Kosul is a solid beater and blocker, card draw engine late game if digging for units to close a game out, and prevents removal spells from killing your board before Palace can beef it up\n3xJotun Hurler is a natural 2 for 1 (considering there's 8 ways to pitch either half), and serves as a random unit upon which to heap Palace buffs. The snowball can threaten Tomb alongside Baby Icaria, and of course kill x/1s\n\nTop End\n4xKorovyat Palace is the centerpiece of this deck, serving as a way to draw cards, fog your board, and beef up your utility units into game ending threats.\n3xMartyr's Chains is the second piece of top end, also serving to beef up your utility units so they can end the game. Chains also turns every single card you draw late into straight fire because power cards are now cost-free slays.\n\nThe Market.\nVision of Austerity is the deck's only relic removal (one of Hooru's main weaknesses). Fortunetly if cast early against a deck using 1 touchstone relic such as Obelisk, it can shut down their entire strategy.\nUnseal currently sits in the market's flex slot. Useful for countering any number of big touchstone spells like Grasping at Shadows or Parliament. Can also counter Scream/Dark Return from Haunted Highway, and Display of Ambition from FJS.\nHailstorm is the go to grab vs aggro in this deck, since you only have 2 maindeck.\nPolymorph on the other hand is the go to grab vs midrange decks just to have another removal spell. Polymorph is especially useful against revenge units or units with entomb (and against Vargo), although its not as good vs units with weapons on them. You can also clear the frog away with your Snowballs.\nKorovyat Palace finds a home here in the market as well, doing all the same stuff it does in the maindeck.\n\nAs of posting this decklist I am climbing through Gold with it and am 11-3, plus I am also 11-3 with an older version called Big Hooru Control.\n\nIf you have any comments or questions about the deck, especially sharing your experience playing the deck if you feel so inclined to do so, comment below, or better yet ping me @14ierophant in the Eternal Discord's #deck_discussion channel."

        "success": "Fantastic deck for beginners. Relatively cheap, though requires 4x Champion of Fury to be playable. Heavily inspired from ManuS' Skycraggo\n\nStrategy: Keep it simple. Play one drops on curve and overwhelm opponent with as much damage as fast as possible. Keep torches and perma late game for stronger units. You also always want to attack with your units - you rarely ever have to worry about blocking as you usually outdamage opponents early on.\n\nCore cards\nChampion of Fury: Most important card in deck. Fantastic for quick damage and just great overall.\nAnkle Cutter: Without him we lose to Titan and Varra every time. Must have 4x imo.\nOni Ronin, Rakano Outlaw: -Warcry buffs are so good early on. A buffed Champion of Fury ends games in a few turns.\nDusk Raider: While a little slow, if you draw a champion of fury with berserk and board is empty, you will get incredible amounts of damage off. Also great for your warcry units a d really any units. The nightfall is also really helpful in terms of providing you with an extra card, which is a godsend for aggro.\n\nCard Explanations\nMischief Yeti: A cheaper version of Pyroknight. While it doesn't have the late game mana sink or overwhelm, it is still fantastic value and synergizes great with the 6 weapons and 4 buff spells in the deck. With this around I honestly wouldn't even bother crafting Pyroknight\nOrnate Katana: Honestly just a cheaper version of Longbarrel. If you have that, use it instead. Notably synergies with Dusk Raider though.\nSmith's Hammer: A much, much worse Shogun's Scepter. If you have that, play that instead.\nSnowfort Trumpeter: A filler card really. Any 2 or three drop that you think is better can go there.\nGranite Acolyte: Another filler. Synergies great with Mischief Yeti though.\n\nUpgrades\nIXTUN MERCHANT. While some deny the importance of a market in skyaggro, I personally believe that a market is incredible for aggro. This card allows you to get rid of an extra power (you only need 3) and get a much better card instead. Craft 4 of them and put em in place of the snowfort trumpeter and the granite acolyte. Fixes many of the inconsistencies with Skycraggro. Market: Up to you, but I really like warhelm. So neat for bursting the following turn (play a unit, play warhelm, attack with merch + unit). My market: Warhelm, Ankle Cutter, Censari Brigade (underwhelming in main deck in my experience), Cloud of Ashes, and Obliterate. Notable options: Unexpected Results allows you to counter harsh rule or hailstorm.\nVadius, Clan Father: Wouldn't be skycraggro without him. Really solid card, but I recommend crafting the merchant and Shogun's Scepter before him. If you have him, take out one ankle cutter (you have one in market), a dusk raider, and a permafrost and slap 4 of him on the deck.\nShogun's Scepter: So much value. Craft 4 of it and replace em with Smith's Hammer and 2 ornate Katana.\nLongbarrel: Craft 2 and sub for Katana.\nPyroknight: Kind of unnecessary as Mischief Yeti does a more than a fine job, but if you really have extra shiftstone, I guess you can craft 4 of them and sub em for the Mischief Yetis. If you already have Pyroknight then definitely play it over Yeti.\n\nUpgraded List"

As always feedback/improvements are greatly appreciated. Oni tend to be paper tigers and wish I could dab in shadow for the Lethrai Target Caller but feel it would dilute the deck too much.

The first few turns are spent setting up, finding the influence you're going to need, and keeping the board from getting out of control. Every now and then, though, the deck just jams the gas and comes gunning out of the gate. If Glasshopper hits the board on turn 2 and survives, Severin, the Mad Mage on turn 3 is straight filth.\n\nThe mulligan is the key to the game - you need to find a Pledge card in your opening hand, and board interaction is usually key. If the pieces don't line up for a fast start, the deck simply outvalues the AI's deck and wins the long game (especially if you can grab Cursed Prophet Deleph from the Market - I've won a few games simply because of him).\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 37 (25 power, 4 Auralian Cargo, 4 Auralian Merchant, and 4 Bear Guard Bayonet.\nInfluence: 23 sources of all colors (counting Auralian Cargo, Bear Guard Bayonet, and Diplomatic Seal as a source for each color - I also assumed an extra source of influence for each color as a result of the Pledge cards. This assumption is probably, at best, sketchy math.)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

Because it's far better to force your opponent to keep their cursed units than give them an obvious choice of which they should sacrifice I was finding that Vara, Vengeance-Seeker should probably be cut. This variant uses Permafrost, Winter's Grasp, and Ice Sprite to ensure their cursed units stick around a while. If you can get control in the mid game with these it's just a matter of time until you get the Profane Censer, and Black Iron Manacles combo to end it.\n\nAs it stands this is a hot mess right now but it has potential. I think Alu, Death-Dreamer would fit in well but haven't committed to crafting her yet."

        "success": "Hey got another great gauntlet deck for y'all, built it a few days ago and have 4 consecutive Gauntlets with it since. Its a super easy deck to pick up and play, only hard matchups are the time decks that just unload tons of big things, but you have 5 vanquishes in the main with a sixth in the market alongside Harsh Rule.\n\n\n\nEdit: made some upgrades to the deck. Picking up a 3 of Geomar, the Steel Tempest was the big one, gets pumped by both Icaria, Valkyrie Captain and Unseen Commando makes it a perfect fit for the deck. Secondly Chains was kinda a dead market slot, so I moved Telut, Queen's Hand in to the top end market slot. Moving one Copperhall Bailiff into the market was a decision I made so I could have something to merchant for the aggressive decks. Over all I think this build is reasonably stronger than the original"

Ultimately, it's frustrating that I have to use Severin instead of a good Elysian pledge card because the silly flyer is just godawful (meanwhile, cough cough, Aniyah, pls.) Just wanted to see if the concept could be done. And, well, it's okay, nothing world-breaking, and ultimately, it doesn't really feel like you gain too much by streamlining the influence demands and playing apex predator and Severin over say, Aniyah and Courier, along with all the other goodies you get from TJP.\n\nUltimately, it's basically a \"can you\" play this deck, as opposed to a \"should you\" play this deck. And you can, and it'll win some games, but ultimately, I think it lacks the bullshit factor found in more refined lists."

        "success": "Its time to flip some tables!\nMuch like StarStorm's Clutch Ruckus, the central idea behind the deck is to spread out amplifiable spells over a number of renown-units in order to trigger multiple abilitys with one high-cost cast.\n\nlet me introduce the main cast:\nRuckus Rouser: This loveable tableflipper is the heart and soul of the deck. Renowning with an amplified Mighty Strikes or Bottoms Up turns him into a small, red nuclear power plant.\nGlacier Shaper: The Yin to Ruckus Rouser's Yang and your main source of defence. Since most of your spells are fast, Glacier Shaper essentially allows you to play an Ambush whenever you need it.\nXo of the Endless Hoard: This guy doesn't really need introduction, but here we go. He's a power 7 dragon that likes to pop Aegises, create value, kill weaklings and soar above the waves in the moonlight.\nKenna, Shaman of the Scale: Since both Xo and Kenna have soewhat high influence requirements and this deck focuses on playing them as early as possible through Rabble Rouser, I put both in the market and draw one depending on my current influence. I prefer Xo, tho.\nBottoms Up (snickers) and Mighty Strikes trigger the Renown of your Oni and Shapers. I hardly use their actual effects. It's more important that they are expensive, spells and hit multiple units.\n\nThe Strategy:\nXo and Kenna are usually your winning conditions. Use Ruckus Rouser to play them early. Then use more Ruckus rousers to create loads of power to either\n-Turn xo's first Attack up to 11\n-cast loads of Spells to beef up Kenna\n\nBut wait! There's more. When you can't find your merchant or don't want to spend your precious Shiftstone for some Legendaries, you can still control the board without them.\nGlacial Shaper, when renowned properly can churn out a monstrosity of eerie proportions and if you're lucky, a Shingane Firebrand may even one-hit your enemy.\n\nLet's do the math:\nQ: Jimmy has 6 power and two Tableflippers on the board and a copy of Mighty Strikes on his hand. What does this allow him to do?\nA: Renowning both Ruckus Rousers will grant Jimmy 24 power for one turn. Depending on the board and hand he can:\n-Renown F Firebrands and/or G Glacial Shapers to dish out 24xF direct damage and/or G 24/24 Overwhelm Ice Dragons.\n-Burn down his neighbours house while creating value with Xo\n-Senselessly play spells to transform Kenna into a freaking beefcake. BEEFCAKE!\n-Play another Mighty Strikes on any unit and deal out some damage.\n\nLet's get to the Sidecast:\nFevered Scout and Softfoot Burglar are your pawns against Aggro. Given their Stats, that sounds ridiculous and it is not that easy to pull off, but if you have enough remaining power and Parry\nGruanform on your hands, they work quite well for a surprise. Especially in Gauntlet, as the AI falls for these tricks all the time. That being said, they also work quite well later in the game, as you will sling spells left right and center.\nSpeaking of slinging spells: Sooner or later there will always be the option to play Pyre Elemental for the low, low cost of 2 power, making it a fairly good drop.\nSkycrag Scalebreaker is mostly in there because I like that gal a lot. Her renown is quite nice, especially since it stacks when you play a copying spell on her. And her Goad lets you renown any unit for four power or send a Schwarzeneggeresque Monstrosity flying. That being said, her 2P influence can also slow you down in some rare cases.\nKosul Huntsman is mostly a filler, but his killer can win you a game when he is high on Mighty Strikes and targets a low-health unit.\nMirror Image and Sudden Schism can renown your units in a pinch wihile leaving the oportunity to use their ability again later. This is especially great for getting Xo on the board and providing him loads of power the following turn. Whether you prefer Mirror Image or Schism is up to you, though keep in mind that higher cost is actually better in this deck and Schism is not only reminds you of Tool but actually provides you two 4def Ambushs when combined with Glacier Shaper.\nYour main problem with this deck will be flyers and the removal spells may help here. Especially since you can crank them up with your Howling Peak Smuggler. And as a neat side-effect, they also act as stereoids for Kenna, the Softfoot Hamburgler and the Scout.\nFinally Staff of the Arch-Magister ramps up quite nicely with all your spells and gives at least some kind of use to all the Treasure troves that you have to discard to reduce your hand back to nine cards. I have not yet used it, though.\n\nIf you are lloking for some replacements for the two legendaries, anything that can profit from enough power will do. It is, of course also possible to focus on one of them and switch your merchants accordingly. and without their influence demands, it may even be possible to splash in some Time, just so you can abuseMaddening Whisper to trigger all the renown abilities (or even Xo's Ultimate) twice.\n\nThis deck is pretty much a first draft and there's a lot room for improvement. Especially since it does not hold to well against many forms of aggo or control (and especially airboune) decks.\n\nAnd if you're still here: Thanks for reading my ramblings! I'm stoked to see any improvements or additions!"

Left 2 for aegis coverage. Plus some minor changes. 26 power seems better for deathcaps.\n\nEdit2: Swapped remaining Vara's for Profane Censers.

Azindel's Gift gave me a lot of surrenders tho.\nI am also thinkink of replacing Dreamsnatchers with Baby Vara completely and leaving Azindel's Gift in the store. I have had really REALLY rarely a situation to use Dreamsnatcher's ultimate.\n\n\nPlease comment your feedback and concerns. : )"

Hailstorm is the flex spot in the deck and you can make those into whatever removal you'd like, I just put them in there because I was running into a lot of aggro decks and it helped the match-up considerably. Your big Rod payoffs in this deck are Eilyn, Apex Predator, and Aniyah. Your best target to put Rod on is Imperial Loyalist. Often times Loyalist will pull another merchant for another rod or for the Sword of Unity but you can also pull cost reduced cards from the deck like a cheaper Eilyn if you have multiple glasshoppers in play.\n\nYou may be wondering, why the Kosul Recruit? I had Serene Meditant in there before and was not a huge fan of his cost, Reyna has a similar issue of costing too much, I ended up settling on Recruit because it helps the aggro matchup once again.\n\nI had about a 60% win-rate up to masters with the deck. Enjoy!"

        "success": "I updated my old Merchant Combo deck from last summer, taking advantage of the Black Market mechanic to give us a higher density of merchants. We now have 12 Time and Primal Merchants and 8 Shadow and Fire Merchants, so the deck is more about finding a quantity of pieces, rather than trying to draw specific cards, which is an issue the old version often faced. If you're unfamiliar with the combo, basically, we try to get Recurring Nightmare down to 0 cost, play an Iceberg Scattershot, and then slam the free Nightmare. The Nightmare pings the opponent for a single damage, doubles its attack value, and puts itself back into our hand. We then execute this loop as many times as our opponent has points of health, or until they see the writing on the wall and concede. Check out the old list to see the exact card interactions we use to go off.\n\nThe Praxis Arcanum is a bit of an experiment, as we only really utilize the cost reduction part of the card in this deck. It's worked out fine for me thus far, and the power base has been warped somewhat to accommodate. Now, even if we never find a Time merchant, if we've drawn an Arcanum, we can use Primal merchant to go get Avisaur, Shadow merchant to go get Nightmare, and on 7 maximum power, just play Arcanum and Scattershot in the same turn. If your opponent isn't presenting any kind of pressure, we can also go off over the course of 3 turns if we get stuck on 4 power by playing Avisaur to bring Nightmare down to 2 cost, pass the turn, Arcanum to uhhh gain 4 health, pass the turn, and then play Scattershot and Nightmare in the same turn.\n\nThings to note:\n- Dont't blow your only Howling Peak Smuggler grabbing a Primal card! This deck can't combo off without an Iceberg Scattershot, which presents a unique challenge for our merchants. The cost-reduction half of the combo can be executed with several multi-faction cards, allowing for a great deal of flexibility with merchants, but the Fire part of the combo can only be grabbed with one of 8 merchants, so use them wisely!\n- Don't be afraid to play a Crest on turn 3 instead of your first Merchant. This deck needs to either grab 4 cards from it market, or grab three cards and draw an Arcanum, so waiting to build up more cards in your hand before you start to fetch the combo pieces is preferred if you can afford the time.\n- You're pretty much only playing Journey Guide on the same turn you play a Shadow or Primal Merchant to go grab Nightmare. Never expect your \"dorky\" units to survive.\n- If it becomes clear that your opponent has a torch or other fast spell interaction, try to pivot into Merchant + Avisaur beats. Even if it doesn't work out, you may just pressure your opponent enough that they spend all their power dealing with the units that don't actually matter\n- Play your Common Cause before your merchants! I can't tell you how many times i've played one of the two remaining Merchants in my hand, only to find myself with a faction-less power card in my hand and an egg on my face.\n\nHaaaaaaaaaaaaaave fun"

This is a lump, with a few factors and small combos that can become unfair. Needs polish.\n\nInstead of giving it that polish though I'm probably going to try and find a way to include Acantha and reduce her cost enough that she can be screamed onto the field over and over, killing everything forever."

        "success": "I've been tooling around with this deck since Beta and Defiance finally gave it the tools to be competitive.\n\nBefore Defiance, you really relied on the combo of Black Iron Manacles and Solitude for the kill; but sometimes Solitude wouldn't be a large enough hit to finish the job. But Mournful Deathcap changes things. It fills your opponents bin ahead of time so Solitude is almost always lethal with a manacles and you can even just deck your opponent with Solitude if they leave your Deathcap alone long enough.\n\nDeathcap of course also pairs amazingly well with Dreamsnatcher. I think the best opening hand is: Turn 1 Crest or leave up Torch, Turn 2 Dreamsnatcher, Turn 3 Deathcap + Power card. It is entirely possible to win a game with just Dreamsnatcher beatdown.\nShakedown Also helps the Dreamsnatcher of course as well as with the Manacles.\nThe Dreamsnatcher and Deathcap have really helped the deck avoid getting run over by aggro decks.\n\nThe Ixtun Merchants are there because the Manacles can really hamper control decks and reanimation decks, so you want to make sure you've got that online as much as possible. And of course Bore can be an absolute savior.\n\nNaturally the removal suite changes with the metagame. Devouring Shadow usually gets -3 to -5 by the time you've got something worth casting it on. In Cold Blood synergizes with Dreamsnatcher and Manacles against Justice cards.\nI've cut back on Devastating Setback since adding Ponysnatchers; sometimes its a 4 for 1 and sometimes its an overpriced Sabotage. I've swaped it for a Stray into Shadows in the Market since Stray doesn't cripple opposing boards as much right now.\n\nThe Treacherys could come out though I'm generally happy with them and they help with the drip damage that the Manacles do."

Then i thought of adding Primal for better draws, better Cargo and the Berserk Inspire from Dusk Raider. Also adding Jotun Feast-Caller to the party :D\n\nThat's when it got funny as I thought of comboing the discount from Journey Guide and Haunting Scream to reanimate the big boys into some Flying/Charge/Killer/Berserk springbreakers beasts! Second Sight went also in immediatly as i never felt happier than casting them for almost free :)\n\nPretty sure this kind of deck exist already but i wanted to try and make it on my own, i'm still not sure on how to balance the market and how many duplicates of the less important card so any comment is more than welcome!\n\nCheers :)"

        "success": "When reireibarker posted about his storm (https://www.a-space-games.com/storm) combo deck awhile ago, I played with it a bunch. It was super cool and fun when it worked, but very inconsistent. I've been playing it again and this deck is the result of the changes I've made(it is still inconsistent and dies to anything that can attack for lethal by turn 5).\n\nThe basic idea is get Calderan Cradle into play, then play a bunch of fast power, a Tamarys, copy the Tamarys, then loop free draw spells, filling the board with dragons. This version of Storm has basically no interaction, and is just focused on comboing off.\n\nExcavate - The main function of this is to act as extra copies of End Of The Barrel, though sometimes you'll get back a dead smuggler or draw spell.\n\nResearch Assistant - Fixing, ramp, tribute enabler for End Of The Barrel, plunder target, banner turner on-er, this cheerful friend does it all.\n\nCull the Deck, Quarry -The main difficulty I had before was fizzling out of draw spells on the combo turn, so I splashed shadow just for these. The influence requirements are FFPPTTS, but you don't need FF til your combo turn(Barrel), and the TT is optional for the monolith in the market, PP is just for wisdom, so hitting influence is almost never a problem.\n\nPlunder - Perfect in this deck, functions as a free draw 2 that triggers Cradle 3 times.\n\nStrategize - if using before the combo turn, the main things you want to tuck back are Xo, excess Tamarys, or excess mirror images.\n\nMirror Image - Remember it will cost 2 after you play out a Tamarys. It's generally better to use additional ones to copy more Tamarys rather that dragons, so that any End of the Barrels drawn net even more power.\n\nWisdom of the Elders - If you need to burn a draw spell before the combo turn to dig, this is generally the first choice, as it is actual card advantage(to help smuggle away stuff) and won't be free with double Tamarys when you go off.\n\nTamarys, the Geomancer - Your opponent can disrupt your combo with fast removal, but this mostly means to try to watch out for equivocate and display of instinct. Non Elysian based decks don't usually have fast removal that affects Tamarys. Avoid running her out there before you're ready if at all possible.\n\nEnd of the Barrel - Sac Research assistant before playing. When tributed, you can play your first Tamarys before playing the second Barrel/Excavating, because tamarys will make the second Barrel cost 5.\n\n* MARKET*\nCalderan Cradle - Always the first thing grabbed\n\nSudden Schism - Emergency 5th copy of Mirror Image.\n\nRiddle Game - Hand reload. Given the draw density of this version of the deck, you don't necessarily need this, but it feels sweet when it draws like 15. Very hard to have enough power for though.\n\nEtched Monolith - Allows you to OTK with a board full of Charge Dragons.\n\nEquivocate - Emergency Removal\n\n\nMy win rate in Casual with this is maybe 30%. And a portion of this is from people snap conceding after I've played two Tamarys and drawn a few, perhaps not realizing that it is far from certain that I've won.\n\nHave any ideas or questions? Are you playing an Icicle Marksman/Hunters Harpoon version? A more controlling version with hailstorms? Let me know in the comments."

I've had long games grinding out 3 Palaces and multiple Bears. The only new card from Homecoming is Desecrate. I was going back and forth between a mix of Annihilate and Slay and this is just better in most situation. The 1x Brel has been amazing in every single game I've played it so I'm thinking of dropping the Dizo's office for more copies. Also this season, I removed Regent's Tomb from market and put 2x in main deck. I'm pretty happy with the move and I find that my first market pick is usually Vanquish now. Telut in market has been MVP and won every game I was able to play him."

Same with Suffocate (might change to Annihilate).\nWhy not just keep Xo as card draw and market fodder? Because unlike some other pundits, I actually hardcast Xo for 7 to win a ton of games on the spot and now I can't do that lol.\n\nAnyways, have fun while you can :)"

There is a back up plan as, if or when scattershot dies then you can scream it back into play then play a herald the same turn for 7 power (non down costed) and try to combo again"

Siraf's Beacon for more bonus if your units on board reaches 3 or more with rats.\n3) Using Blood Quill to recover life by attaching with Berserk units mid/late game\n4) Haunted Scream to finish the game with one of the Berserk Units or follow up with Dark Return to finish with a unit that gained charge and flying.\n\nTaking note of some of the common/uncommon cards that performed well:\n\n- Dusk Raider\n- Blood Quill\n- Kerendon Steward\n- Civic Peace Keeper\n\nOne of the key concepts in draft is to analyze which factions are available at an early stage and collect the cost-friendly, high-tier commons and uncommons. In this context It was fortunate for me to get a good number of Dusk Raiders and Kerendon Steward. I almost always try to get Civic Peace Keeper these days if I am playing Justice as it is one of the best Empower Skills for late game out there."

Also has the advantage of being able to play Teacher to give you a solid early body for bayonet.\n\nUsually pledge for time so bayonets get you towards TTT for the Apex predator.\n\nMarket is still in flux but fairly happy with the main. Going with dark return over Dusk Raider for now as it is a way better top deck, despite missing out on the potential of berserk Cykalis'."

        "success": "This is based on LocoPojo's Orene Eilyn deck. I started with his list, then tweaked it as I played from Gold 2 to Masters (I was the 16th person there this month). This is what I ended up with, but I'm still testing modifications. The basic idea is to use Hojan, Icaria, Bear Guard Bayonet and Copperhall Bracers to ramp into bombs. It's very proactive as all the interaction is in the Market or on Weapons/Units.\n\nStrats\n\nThe strategy is pretty straightforward, but it can be kind of tricky to execute sometimes. The main important thing is ramping/fixing as the deck is filled with expensive bombs but runs 25 power and no Seek Power effects (although it does have 10+ pledge units). For example it's usually correct to wait until 3 to play Hojan if you have a Bayonet. It's also usually right to grab a power from the Market if you already have a 6+ drop (or even a bunch of 4+ drops) ready. The main exception to this would be if you really need a specific answer like Defiance or Vision.\n\nThe deck is packed with bombs so making the game go longer is usually the right play. You can have some very explosive draws, but usually you're just trying to ramp, stay alive, and stay even on board until you can start playing 5+ drops to win.\n\nGenerally you want to redraw (to 7 not 6) if you don't have pledge but there are plenty of very keepable hands without it. If you have a good proactive curve, especially if you have some ramp or a Merchant, then it's fine to keep a no-pledge hand.\n\nNearly all the interaction is on Weapons/Units so you have to be careful about how you use your threats (since they're also your removal). Knowing the matchup is pretty valuable as things like knowing when to use Enforcer as a 3 drop 3/3 vs a Silence can win or lose you games. All of the interaction is like this but some more than others - 8 drop Eilyn is always going to have a good target (but sometimes you want to save her for a site). The main cards to really think about using this way are Enforcer, Vanquisher's Blade, and the Merchant (especially if you're running Harsh Rule and/or Vanquish).\n\nThe main important Market cards are Defiance, Banner, and Palace. They were super excellent and I'd never change them. Vision of Austerity is probably not useful often enough to be worth, but it's also meta dependent. Eilyn was somewhat useful but I don't think she's really necessary. Harsh Rule, Vanquish, and Auric Runehammer are on the top of my list for Market cards to try. Right now I'm testing Harsh Rule and Vanquish instead of Eilyn and Vision and it seems pretty alright.\n\nCards\n\nKorovyat Palace is goddamn ridiculous, usually it's what you use to win. Theoretically Svetya is great for the deck with 35 units but it's actually pretty hard to get through the Agenda without winning the game, I think I only got to her once. Every Agenda card is great, although Sack the City is definitely the least useful. But playing Palace as Sack the City to deal a bunch of extra damage and/or force some bad blocks is a common wincon. Sometimes you need to use the Site as Wisdom + a distraction, but that's usually a last resort.\n\nReyna, the Unwavering and Amilli, Cloudmarshal have both been pretty nice. The extra Pledge from Reyna is great and she's straight up impossible to kill (or much harder) for a decent number of matchups. And if not, a 6 drop 6/7 with Endurance is usually pretty strong. Amilli is just a nice synergy card. He's a Valkyrie for Icaria, a good cheap blocker, and a one card wincon. Plus he's crazy good with the site.\n\nIf you don't have Reyna or Amilli (or you want a more aggressive build), the 4 cost Svetya would be a good replacement. In fact, I'm testing 4 of her instead of Reyna and Amilli right now. I'm still not sure if it's better overall but it's definitely better in some ways. Silverwing Courier is another potentially good option, the Pledge synergy is obviously nice but it's also a Valkyrie for Icaria. It's very possible the Courier is the best card for that spot.\n\nBoth Eilyns have been great, the only one I'd cut is in the market. And it's probably worth putting her back in the main. Eilyn, the Rising Storm is definitely better as a wincon, but Eilyn, Clan Mother isn't strictly worse. A lot of games end with you beating them down with a succession of Eilyns. Generally you want to play them proactively, it's rarely worth waiting for a good target. The main exception is if you have other bombs that can win like Palace and Amilli to soften them up first, or if you know they're going to play a Site or some important unit.\n\nLinebreaker's Shield and Vanquisher's Blade play similar roles but neither is always better so I think 3 of each is correct. The main reason you want them is the 2 cost 2/2 weapon part. Copperhall Bracers is nice redundancy for all the main themes of the deck. It's ramp, a renown activator, an attack buff, and a way to convert a decent board into a strong advantage. But it also kind of clogs up your hand, and it's not really the best at any of those things, so I think 2-3 is the right amount. Bear Guard Bayonet is actually pretty nice without Pledge as a way to give random huge units some evasion or buff a Borderscout, but it's still pretty mediocre. However with Pledge it's absolutely nutty and well worth building this entire deck around.\n\nShadowlands Borderscout wouldn't be in the deck without pledge (unless it had better stats), but it's actually amazing and low-key one of the best cards in the deck. Obviously when it gets to stick and draw a bunch of cards you'll probably win in a very commanding fashion (if you weren't already). Even drawing one card with it is nice, But the real reason it's great is it gives the deck another angle of attack as well as yet another must-answer threat to overload their removal. A Borderscout is extremely threatening regardless of its attack damage, your opponent's life total, and even board state to some extent. Basically, playing it forces your opponent to spend cards/power interacting with you unless they're very far ahead. The deck wants to be the aggressor as much as possible, so this is extremely valuable to regain the initiative or keep them on their back foot.\n\nOverall the deck feels really strong. I'd say it's probably the best Hooru deck I've played so far, and one of the best ways to use Palace. The meta is obviously in flux but I'd say something like this will probably be tier 1/2 once it settles. Adding Fire or Shadow might make the deck better, but I'm not sure exactly how I want to do that and this version is very strong already."

I tend to hold any Gathering Lights until I need the health boost or they'll finish filling the board. The Xenan Obelisks help improve the body of your guys so they stand a chance of staying on the board.

If possible, your best target to copy is always Glasshopper, since it should create an extra unit as well as make it cheaper. Failing that, you can copy Severin (3 Severins gets crazy with free Ring activations), or a killer Moonstone Vanguard, or even the opponent's units!"

All shadow cards are removed and this is a pure Elysian deck now.\n\nThe main idea behind the deck is to play some awesome pledge cards: Moonstone Vanguard, Eilyn, the Rising Storm and Apex Predator. Glasshopper creates more copies of the pledged card, and makes all of them cheaper.\n\nJourney Guide, Nesting Avisaur and The Praxis Arcanum in the market make cards cheaper, and Trail Maker, Auralian Merchant and Eternity Core help ramping.\n\nLunar Magus is a good 3-drop and helps with life gain. Nightfall from Dusk Raider and Twilight Hunt goes well with it.\n\nExcavate kinda replaces Dark Return. Sudden Schism is very useful while facing removal/ambush."

The balance between pledge/ramp support and midrange threats + late game value seems very good to me.\n\nMerchant - If you're intending to play ramp then I don't see a case for Jennev Merchant being better than Winchest Merchant. You lose Savagery and maybe a few other cards but gain access to Martyr's Chains and Vanquish or Harsh Rule.\n\nUnits - Once again, if you're playing ramp then I don't see too many flex spots for units as the ones with pledge are pretty much essential. I suppose you could flex Imperial Loyalist for Shadowlands Borderscout. That said, Icaria, Valkyrie Captain has been one of the best performing cards in the deck for me - I've won a lot of games from opponents ignoring her for too long and her turning into beater very quick. Valkyrie Enforcer is another card that has performed super well for me. Silence is very good right now and playing it on curve adds to pressure which is ideal for this deck. Silencing opposing flyers so yours can get through and being able to turn off Vargo Redclaw or Vara, Vengeance-Seeker in a race is great. Eilyn, Clan Mother has also been great for me and probably better than Telut, Queen's Hand even though I've been very tempted to see how Telut performs here.\n\nRemoval - I think you need to run 3-4 Vanquisher's Blade in the main here. It renowns/buffs a unit while serving as great removal and providing the extra anti-graveyard benefit. I haven't needed any Defiance so far but that's another card that could be good if you want to try it out. If you do try it I would suggest you use it in addition to the Blades, not in place of them.\n\nFluff - I'm not sure if Copperhall Bracers should be something else. It's very likely. I could see adding in some removal or a couple of Honor of Claws in that spot.\n\nQuestions and critique is always welcome"

It has a secondary goal of getting Calderan Cradle from the market asap and pumping out dragons.\n\nEcho spells have a great synergy with both Diogo M\u00e1laga, Elonze and Calderan Cradle. When an echo spell has Destiny, both copies will get played, which means you also get to draw two additional cards.\n\nMoment of Creation quickly becomes massive and often plays for free from Destiny. You'll also ramp enough to play Channel the Tempest if that too doesn't receive Destiny.\n\nPlaying Diogo M\u00e1laga, Elonze on 6 power is fine, but if you think you will reach the next even number by next turn, I usually wait. Amplifying two or three times makes a big difference but it's still very good with just one:\n-Torch is usually the worst card to hit, followed by Equivocate (unless you happen to need it).\n-Find the Way and Unstable Form, will draw you a couple of extra cards, with the latter being especially good if you have Mind Link going.\n-Wisdom of the Elders is like drawing three cards.\n-Moment of Creation and Channel the Tempest are obviously brutal cards when free.\n\nUsing the free Mirror Image on a turn after Howling Peak is played, can get you massive amplifies on Diogo.\n\nStill a work in progress. May swap out Mind Link for Kaleb's Choice."

        "success": "Ever wanted to complete the 'deal one million damage' achievement? What if I told you it could be done in one game? The following is probably the most efficient way to get this achievement. What I have here to offer is more of a strategy than a set-in-stone deck; It can be adjusted based upon your budget needs. Let's talk about what is absolutely necessary for the strategy to function\n\n1: 1 copy of Talir's Unwinding\nThis card is absolutely pivotal to the deck's success. It shuffles both players' decks, allowing the game to continue for a much longer time (and it's going to be a very long game). Its \"your opponent draws 7 cards\" clause makes it seem so useless, but that is exactly why It's good here. More on that later.\n\n2: 1: Access to the Azindel boss fight at the end of the Vara campaign.\nStarting with a high power count makes this much less tedious than if you were to try to get the achievement vs. say, a gauntlet opponent. You will actually need to have the into shadow campaign anyways in order to use the card:\n\n3: Messenger Hawk\nSince Talir's Unwinding has voidbound, we will need a way to put more copies into our deck in order to play infinitely.\n\n4: A set of merchants that can fetch your Talir's unwinding.\nSince Azindel has ways to discard the top of your deck, it is safer to put Talir's Unwinding in the market. My only advice is to avoid Auralian Merchant because it has no attack, and you will need to have units that can attack to get the achievement.\n\n5: At least one copy of Martyr's Chains This card allows us to get our units to 999/999. More copies is always preferrable, as it allows you to set up your damage engine faster, but once you get going, having more doesn't affect it at all. Remember that you can get a copy of chains in one of the theme decks for 2500 gold if you don't have one.\n\n6: At least one copy of Scourge of Frosthome\nthis is important because it prevents Azindel from interacting with our units or relics, and ensures that he will do nothing but put units on the board.\n\n7: tutors, cards that let you search your deck for other cards.\nThe most important one is Display of Knowledge. This lets you grab chains from your deck, and later in the game it lets you swing into deadly units, and use it as a fast spell to give your unit quickdraw-- keeping it alive. Celestial Omen and Rise to the Challenge are also great.\n\n8: a few non-evasive bodies to fill out your board. Prefferably cantripping ones like Temple Scribe and Heart of the Vault because they make it easier to get your set up early. It's important that these units can be blocked by opponent's so you don't win the game. Putting at least one lifesteal unit in your deck can be important so you don't die to nightfall.\n\n9: more cards to fill out your deck so you have 75 cards. I like Frost Talisman because it stabilizes early and you can use your 50 power to dig through a lot of your deck. Card draw in general is nice.\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe Strategy\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nBefore you begin, check the achievements page. See how much damage you need to do to get the achievement and divide that number by 999. Remember the number.\n\nMulligan for a hand with a good number of combo pieces/card draw. Azindel will go first, so remember that you can use your cards like Display and Celestial Omen on his turn.\n\nPut a Scourge into play as quickly as possible. You really don't want azindel breaking your chains because you will have to use Talir's Unwinding to get them back.\n\nBuild up your board to stop his attacks. During this time, get as many chains into play as possible. Remember that if you only have one Chains, you can use a hawk to put more into your deck. Remember also not to play power once you have chains down unless you need to do so to stay alive.\n\nOnce you have some 999/999 units on board, you can start attacking. Remember not to attack with more units than he has blockers, or else you will win.\n\nUse Messenger Hawk to make copies of Talir's Unwinding, and then play it. This will give your opponent 7 more cards on his turn so he can build out his board. This will allow you to attack again. Count the number of times one of your unit attacks so that you don't play for too long or not long enough.\n\nuse hawk on talir's unwinding enough that there are a lot of talir's unwindings in your deck, but not every single card. You want to be able to cast this almost every turn. Once you have a comfortable number, use hawk only every 4 times you reshuffle.\n\nAttack the sufficient number of times, and then kill azindel. You have gotten the achievement!"

Gunrunner is a decent card overall, but I like it more in an aggressive version.\n\nVanguard and Cykalis are both great to pledge, but generally Vanguard is the better option.\n\nPurify is simply here to counter specific cards that would otherwise completely stop this deck, most notably Silverwing Courier.\n\nThere's a lot of fire sigils in the deck compared to time sigils, despite the deck being ~70% time. That's because the plan is to pledge for time T1 most games. I'm sure it can be optimized somehow, but I found this balance to work really well."

The idea was to prey upon all the new Ixtun decks that want to play Vargo. Anyways, the deck feels pretty good as of right now because it can be aggressive while still putting up a solid fight against aggro. I don't know. Still testing the deck. Don't know exactly how I want to tune it yet.\n\nPalace is really good in the market.\n\nOn Second Glance:\nThis deck feels incredibly strong with the current meta though I'm uncertain how long this particular meta will last. Rakano aggro is already very good as a much up due to giving our growing units killer. The midrange match-up feels very draw dependent as we usually can out aggro them with the value game dependent on whether we draw a merchant. Literally, the site out of the market is soooo good, Enough that I've considered putting it into the main board. Aniyah feels a little weak in the main but the pledge means it doesn't hurt as much as you might think. The biggest issue with this deck is getting your creatures to stick because if you do, the tempo can bowl your opponent over. Savageryneeds to be something else though I'm not sure what. Suggestion welcome on that front. Funny enough, I keep finding other people on ladder who are playing this deck and that's super funny. Your best units all do very poorly against defiance and I'm considering adding Stand Together somewhere in this deck. Not sure where. Probably gonna replace Savagery"

Steal that crap, they have +2 card advantage on you? Start getting a free draw end of turn.\nIt can suck if they chain brilliant ideas, a good rule of thumb is if they have +6 card advantage it might be time to cut your loss and get on with the next game.\n\nHope you guys enjoy it as much as i have :) cheers."

Also, I somehow missed that I had teched the deck way down; Aurialian cargo is not necessary.\n\nThis is a board based deck that uses the new Homecoming pledge synergies to flood the board with damage and generate card advantage with Severin, Glasshopper, and Dread. This allows you to fight for board with aggro while outlasting them in the midgame.\n\nAlso, it feels like Severin is being overlooked even in Glasshopper decks which is a shame because he does a lot for Auralian in terms of color fixing, mana cheating, and just general relic pressure. Also, if you have the Homecoming campaign, this deck is relatively budget friendly.\n\nUnfortunately for these type of board based tempo decks, there are too many strong counterplay options, and control decks win the day in Eternal, but it's still fun to play with.\n\nBasically, the strategy is to always mulligan for pledge with the best options being Severin for color fixing or sometimes Moonstone Vanguard if you can pull it off without sacrificing Auralian colors. Always, ALWAYS pledge turn 1. Then just hit the board as fast as possible using Cykalis to push even more damage. One thing to note is that Lethrai Hideaway is the only relic which really ties the deck together providing an extra unit, cheap buffs with Severin, a buff for the smuggler, and ultimately a win-condition with Borderscout.\n\nI've found Cirso's Cleaver to be a surprisingly powerful finisher for this deck, so I feel like it is the most important card in the market. Beyond that you have a lot of different options, but this is my best iteration so far."

This deck requires you understanding of match you play, continuous count of potential damage and cards you can draw.\n\nDeck Design\n- 28 Units, 8 One Drops, 12 Two Drops, 8 Three Drops\n- 22 Spells, 12 Buffs, 4 Direct Damage, 4 Cycling, 2 Utility\n- 25 Power Cards\n\nGeme Plan\nSetup your board during first 3 turns and finish game in one swing. We want few things to achieve victory.\n- Play as cheap spells as possible coz we want to play as many of those as possible per turn\n- Draw as many spells as we can, this achieved with cycling or some units\n- Have units that benefit from spell pays\n- Have threatening units that can finish game in one turn\n- Have evasion for units to push through blockers\n\nCards & Reasoning\nUnits\n- Powderglider: good body with so needed buff from spell plays, has an upside in scope of Summon ability, can stun Flyer if drawn later.\n- Softfoot Burglar: another one drop that benefits from spell plays and provide cycling spells to chain spells as many as possible.\n- Dusk Raider: two drop unit that make our other units quite threatening, also draws cards for us and deals damage to opponent from Nightfall triggers.\n- Hotblood Barbarian: two drop threatening unit due to berserk, also provides spell in exchange of card in hand.\n- Yeti Snowslinger: two drop that adds spell to hand if dealt damage to opponent.\n- Crunch, the Hoarder: fulfills all we want, card draw, threat and overwhelm makes sure we get to face.\n\nSpells\n- Jump Kick: Buff + Evasion for our unit, quite good for this price.\n- Kaleb's Intervention: +2/+2 and Overwhelm in most cases to push through with buffed unit, other mods are sometimes useful too.\n- Torch: blocker removal or face finish, nothing to say more.\n- Parry: protection for our units and probably way to deal with blocker or trick opponent into inefficient trade.\n- Rampage: main buff that can result into huge damage due to Berserk and Units that benefit from spell plays.\n- Mighty Strikes: reason why this overpriced Kaleb's Intervention in deck is because of Amplify ability and Fast speed, this can give two units Overwhelm, but it is still counted as one spell played.\n- Read the Stars: cycling with upside, deal damage and draw one more card.\n\nTips & Tricks\n- Snowball, Temper + Softfoot Burglar: you can target your Burglar to get buff trigger and draw spell.\n- Crunch, the Hoarder + Parry: you can kill one life unit and deal rest damage to the face, this way you will trigger Infiltrate ability and draw two cards with potential of getting Berserk.\n- Play fast buffs on Fast only if possible.\n\nDon't forget to hit that like button.\nLeave a comment if you have feedback or suggestion."

While going back and forth in D1 I noticed alot of pledge decks either hooru or 3f and I wondered to myself if feln had what it took to beat these decks along with the various rakano decks I was facing, turns out it can and I think it actually has a spot in the meta.\nVara, Vengeance-Seeker is a must right now if you are playing any sort of shadow deck - it is crucial to remove aegis from the various hooru decks, esp Withstand from Korovyat Palace\nChampion of Cunning - I know it seems strange to play a unit with aegis of your own when you play Vara but Champion is just that good - it still buffs your squad and if they kill this then they aint killing your vara (and tbh vara is usually a magnet for removal as soon as you play her)\nDesecrate and Honor of Claws are fantastic additions to this deck - Feln's cheap removal is very specific to what it can kill so happy to have Desecrate here while Honor allows you to dig deeper into your deck for your threats while ditching power or kill spells that you can't use.\nI'm playing 4 Suffocate because everything i'm playing against has multiple hits (smugglers, maidens, enforcers, hojans, etc)\nRight now im playing Annihilate as my other cheap removal over Rindra's Choice because of all the pledge units being mostly single faction.\nIn Cold Blood is just a fantastic and brutal card against the FJS Smugglars and Hooru decks so im playing 3 you can interchange this with feeding time if you are seeing reanimator/mirrors/xenan recursion.\nBlack-Sky Harbinger - I love this card - Its another source of life gain, an evasive threat, breaks aegis, deals with go wide strategies (grenadins/praxis tokens), hits sites and relic weapons.\nDizo's office - A kill spell, value engine, and hard to deal with permanent. You don't get to use the lifesteal effect all to often but the site is still great."

Having Equivocate instead of Permafrost has been a nice addition as we finally have an answer to Plate.\n\nYou can wait until you see an EoH on top of your deck before playing Diogo, but even if the Destiny doesn't hit EoH, it often ends up being helpful.\n\nI've had good results against all the FJP/FJS decks running around.

        "success": "After trying out a ton of Xenan/Aurelian/other three color decks with Time and Shadow after the release of Homecoming, this is what ended up being the most successful for me on ladder. I'll go through the cards in it in order of importance, and considerations I didn't end up playing.\n\n---\nKEY CARDS\nMaindeck:\n\nTeacher of Humanity\nCursed Prophet Deleph\nEbon Dune Smuggler\nVara, Vengeance-Seeker\nMoonstone Vanguard\nXenan Temple\nVara's Favor\nAt Least 10 Pieces of Hard Removal\n\nMarket:\nIn Cold Blood\nAzindel, Revealed\n---\n\nYou aren't playing the same deck as me if you aren't running these cards. They all are excellent for various reasons. Teacher of Humanity is good on curve with upside against control, Deleph combos with her. Vara is, as always, real good. Moonstone Vanguard gives you late-game sustain and defends against aggro. Xenan Temple just does a bit of everything--- removes, draws, fucks up Revenge decks. Vara's Favor is great because there's a ton of dangerous x/1 drops being played right now, including Initiate, Hojan and Kerendon Merchant, and the fixing is often key to get to 5 and then 7. Ebon Dune Smugger is great in this deck specifically for the interactions with In Cold Blood and Azindel. The opposing player can't counterplay against a Smuggler on 3 into an In Cold Blood on a Merchant or other key Justice threat on 4, and likewise can't prepare for a Smuggler on 7 on an empty board into an Azindel on 8 that gets you a card immediately. I've won multiple games off both of these. Finally, I've seen some other Xenan decks try to jam as many hard-to-deal with units in a deck as possible and neglecting removal, but sometimes you just need an answer against a Heart of the Vault or something else you can attack through.\n\n---\nGOOD CARDS\nMaindeck:\nInitiate of the Sands\nDesecrate\nBanish\nSandstorm Titan\nDizo's Office\n\nMarket:\nXenan Initiation\nStray into Shadow\n---\n\nThese cards are all important to the gameplan, but could be potentially shifted around. Initiate obviously helps you ramp to the all-important 4 and 5 drops, Sandstorm Titan is still good and really helps against the glut of flyers in the current Meta, and Dizo's Office does a ton for you but is a 7 drop so could potentially be changed if you wanna go more aggressive. I really like Banish in the maindeck because it's so versatile, but you could shift it to the side if you want, and Desecrate is an excellent card when you have board control but rough in a late-game topdecking situation where the opponent has pushed you below 10 health, which is why I advise not running more than 3. In the market, Xenan Initiation is a staple that can flip board control and Stray into Shadow helps against aggro.\n\n---\nFLEX CARDS\nMaindeck:\nAmaran Stinger\n\nMarket:\nPassage of Eons\n---\n\nI've not been super-impressed with Amaran Stinger's performance in this shell. Sometimes she helps, sometimes she feels like she isn't enough to improve your board position. One of the more dead drops in the deck late game. Passage of Eons is just a personal preference for me over Disjunction, but they could be flipped or Passage could even be removed entirely if you want to keep 4 Banishes maindeck.\n\n---\nNOTABLE EXCLUSIONS\nPonysnatcher\nVara's Choice\nThe Praxis Arcanum\nWorldbearer Behemoth\n---\n\nEveryone wants to fit Ponysnatcher in their Shadow decks post-Homecoming, but from my experience it only goes off so often, and when it is blocked it's a 2/2, which does nothing for your board position and trades poorly with more or less every unit played in Constructed. Vara's Choice is the card in this bunch I miss the most and wish I could find room for it. Praxis Arcanum doesn't really impress me, it's fragile and the spells are often dead plays, though if you did want to play it you'd probably also wanna play Behemoth and some other on-attack type units."

        "success": "There are many ways to make Champion of Order work as a win condition.\nThis strategy involves the use of Strangers. Meditative Stranger is rather weak on its own but it can be a solid blocker with Hearty Strangers nearby. The idea is simple:\n\n1- Play Meditative Stranger\n2- Next turn, play Champion of Order and immediately play Stranger's Mark on him. Just make sure your opponent does not have a torch in hand when you play Stranger's Mark.\nYou won't win the game instantly, but once you have 2 big Champions on the field, your victory should be inevitable.\n\nUnfortunately, Stranger's Mark is a worthless card in your hand unless you have all the combo pieces assembled. So you may have to fetch it with Celestial Omen in the market.\nReunite helps you fetch any stranger you need for defense or combo purposes. Even though Meditative Stranger is essential in the combo, you can still win with CoO alone if your opponent lacks removal...\n\nQuicksilver Mirror and Nostrix are luxury cards in this deck. I think they can be replaced with something better, but I can't think of anything right now. Your feedback would be appreciated.\n\nEDIT: Switched to a Justice market for more consistent control with Harsh Rule"

        "success": "So I wanted to play around with a fun deck and now I'm scared. The deck is currently 10-3 in gold. With the pledge, tempo, and late game decks running around, this deck is set up kinda well. Being able to consistently deal 15 to 20 damage by turn 5 is very good. Tempo requires set up, and this keeps them stuck on the backfoot playing defense the whole game. The powerbase is wonky, but that's more cause I don't have all the crests. You can play around with the market. I went for a more aggressive market running Feeding Time to deal with re-animator and Madness to move a big blocker and go for the kill. Jotun Feast-Caller isn't necessary but Rilgon's Disciple is. You don't need it but i recommend keeping Avigraft its good removal for baby vara. Overall I'm having a lot of fun with it and recommend it for everyone."

There has been a new set, a campaign, and some nerfs/buffs since I last updated/looked at the deck and boy did we get some good ones. Dizo's Office is a huge addition while we also picked up Rhysta from set 5. Desecrate though is one of the best cards to come out of the campaign (the site being the actual best) we have incidental lifegain so the damage is barely noticeable then we get ponysnatcher another double shadow two drop which shadow is not short of but right now might be the best one to play because of how warping/important markets are.

The toughest thing is Diamond right now seems to be FILLED with Palace decks of some sort or another and being in those colors so I feel forced to include one in the market but it leaves little room for flexibility in building. 1 Warhelm is probably wrong but I couldn't bring myself to entirely leave it out or play 4 and not play Sharpshooter.\n\nAlso not sure this is the optimal use of bayonet and hojun but where there are must play cards, one must play them? That's how it feels anyway."

        "success": "It's time to come home (to Master's ranks).\n[Update as of 9-4-2019]\nXo has been pushed up to 8 and FFFF now. Understandably. And the metagame is starting to adjust to this particular iteration of Ixtun Palace as well. So I came back to this list and made a few changes, firstly, I redid the market and put 1 Xo in there for continued market cheatyface plays with merchants. Often you want to generate your value by swapping Hurlers out so perhaps the count there goes up to 3 again, I haven't decided. I have added 3 Hammer and 3 Display now maindeck. Display of Honour is surprisingly good even in a deck unlikely to bring two weapons back to use once again, here it also serves as a nasty trick on Vargo to establish board position when your opponents really don't expect a control deck to be running a pump suite. It also grabs Deepforged Plate back if you get blown out, plus bonus goat content. This list is still very much in a great position. The Xo nerf actually kind of helps us, to make some decisions about the maindeck if nothing else!\n\nOriginal Intro:\nI got very tired of playing against FJS so when I saw Vargo Redclaw spoiled I absolutely knew I had to build around him, he gives that deck so many headaches!\n\nSo, little did I know that Direwolf would also release an absolutely savage midgame site as well, one that fits perfectly into our strategy: Korovyat Palace. We are going to be seeing that card everywhere, I promise you.\n\nThis deck is about pure value generation. We use the tried and tested 8 merchant package together with 1 market Xo of the Endless Hoard and 2 Jotun Hurler, alongside a range of other cards you can ship to the market if they do not fit your board position. We have numerous little two-card soft combos, the most obviously juicy is to make your opponent over-extend with a Vargo out, and then Harsh Rule them. That's often a game ending play, on curve.\n\nPeople will note there are 4 Torch cards in this list, 4 Defiance, and 2 Vanquish. You can change the removal package to suit your style and your ladder meta. I find Defiance a good draw as the game goes on, and this deck really benefits from a clutch swing play by stunning a beefy dude on the block. I like Vanquishes for easily getting rid of Varas and establishing an uncontested Vargo early on. The market is pretty standard, note that you will quite often be going to get Rizahn because he is degenerate with aegis and endurance from our Site, but pressure plays with our Red Canyon Smuggler are also pretty common. You will be grabbing Xo back a lot too.\n\nMatch-ups: So far it wrecks FJS, which is the point. You need to play carefully against Reanimator, you only have one out against them unless you have a mitt full of Harsh Rules. Agro is pretty decent, they will have to spend a lot of resources getting rid of Vargo. The deck plays very similar to Jennev midrange anyways, and has a close match-up against it. The fight here is one for Board control, so getting a palace down with a unit out to absorb that +4/+4 and aegis is clutch.\n\nHappy homecoming!"

        "success": "Overview\nBurn is one of my favorite archetypes in TCGs so after some playing around with both a Skycrag and Stonescar list, I decided to just mash both of them together. Unfortunately, doing this makes our powerbase very awkward (be prepared to sometimes get color-screwed) and slow. The main idea of this deck is very simple; throw spells at your opponents face until they die and pray you're faster before you run out of gas.\n\nWe're not running many troops in order to have our opponent's removal be mainly dead draws. All the troops we are actually running have charge for immediate value or have some other benefit (merchant is obvious and ticking grenadin is usually just extra torches to the face).\n\nMarket\nThe market can be played around with but the only absolute mandatory card is Factory Quota. You will straight up lose to lifesteal dorks without it. This card can sometimes single-handily let you beat this deck's nemesis: Vara, Vengeance-Seeker\n\nThe banner is mainly to color-fix; all of our good burn spells require double fire and Champion of fury wants double primal\n\nCombust is emergency removal; sometimes we can't let that Deepforged-plate merchant or Xo sit on the field.\n\nHailstorm lets us blow out aggro or tokens which are rough matchups although Torrential Downpour might be better, I haven't tested it.\n\nBacklash doubles as a burn spell as well as protection against removal or sweepers.\n\nMatchups\nAggro\nCards to grab: Hailstorm, Combust, Factory Quota (against Rakano)\nAggro can be pretty tough; our powerbase is clunky and they can often just run us over as we're color-fixing due to an abundance of depleted power. However lifesteal threats/spells of our own gives us game against aggro decks. Try to keep hands with Grief, Extract, Torch (obv), and especially Highwayman. And whatever you due KILL HOJAN ON SIGHT\n\nMidrange\nCards to grab: Backlash, Factory Quota (against FJS/Xenan)\nFor the most part, midrange decks are pretty even. Usually midrange piles run a bit too much removal that makes them have a slow clock against us. Ixtun (barring the rare Whirling Duo) and Jennev run no lifegain at all meaning our spells/units are very real clocks against them and we can put them into lethal range from a burn spell off the top.\n\nThe tough part comes from FJS and Xenan/Kerendon decks running baby Vara. We absolutely cannot beat this card so make sure you try to merchant a Factory Quota to at least try and race before Bore/Banish/Disjunction comes down.\n\nControl/Combo/Ramp\nWhat to grab: Backlash\nI'm grouping these all together because they pretty much are the same as far as we're concerned. These are usually good matchups for us. With no opposing clock for the most part from all of these, we have free reign to simply pelt our opponent with all we got. Our units almost always get in if you play them when the opponent has no power up and our deck is so redundant and inevitable that no amount of removal/counterspells/discard will stop us. Another good thing is that our reach can easily beat otherwise unbeatable board states (like obliterating your opponent for lethal when they went off with reanimator and put a million dudes into play or staring down a bunch of guys pumped by Martyr's Chains)\n\nOther options\nJust some other random cards that I've tried/can be run\n\nBore (in the market): Usually not great, we can usually remove small units before they get equipped and if you haven't finished off a deck that's running something like Chains or Pit of Lenekta by the time they get it, you're probably dead anyway.\n\nPiercing Shot: Not that bad, helps the aggro matchup by being removal and reach, but it just never feels amazing. Can probably be swapped in for Grief to go even more unitless\n\nSignal Flare: I ran this for a while and it's just not good enough. It hitting site's is irrelevant for the most part (we need all the burn to the face) and it's not fast. Decent if you want to improve against aggro though.\n\nCard draw (Wisdom of the Elders/Strategize): Simply too slow for the most part. We need to kill our opponent ASAP and drawing cards is turns not killing our opponent. I guess you can run these if you want to crush control harder.\n\nMadness: Can easily steal you games (especially against Timedudes.dek) but it's mediocre without sac effects. Definitely worth considering if you want.\n\nBandit Queen: Our deck doesn't go wide enough for Queens effect to matter so she's often just a bad Highwayman. Still a decent choice as 4 power quickdraw/charge is alright even for a turn\n\nCensari Brigand: With no way to pump this, this card is often mediocre and trades down too much. It's still viable if you want to run it.\n\nOni Ronin: Good ol onion boy is alright. However, he's a horrible topdeck and warcry means little with how little troops we're running\n\nVara, Vengeance-Seeker: The main reason to run this is to pop Aegis (especially face aegis) which is a problem. It's always a good card but it turns on our opponents removal really well and is slow for what we want to do.\n\nConclusion\nIf you want to run an aggro deck that's a little different (although not super top-tier), I suggest giving this deck a shot. Topdecking a burn them all right when the opponent slams that Xo that was going to lethal you is really fun and knowing when to go face or remove units with your spells also gives this deck some interesting decisions compared to some other aggro decks."

I've looked on here and tried a few lists, hut they always seemed clunky. So in my searches, and testing I've found this list has so far worked the best for me. Eventually I will replace some power stones with 2 more crests, though i digress.\n\nThe deck is fairly self explanatory, you want to draw as many sentinels as possible, reducing their cost, and increasing your power cap."

Also added Dizo's office as a ramp payoff.\nDid add the second chains because as the commenters mentioned, it is relevant to have two in the deck.\n\nFormerly I had hourglass, previous description about hourglass: I went with hourglass as the market relic because it is the cheapest relic that might have an impact on the board, and is fetchable by both smugglers. Especially good if Hooru aggro running Aniyah continues to be popular, or you run into people still running permafrost. This also allows you to technically combo off with only 4 mana, which might be necessary sometimes. You can smuggler turn 3, Governor turn 4 against a deck you don't think can kill it, then you can go off next turn without needing to draw a 5th undepleted mana. Also just Great Valley Smuggler as a 4/4 endurance can be pretty annoying for aggro decks."

        "success": "The new campaign gave reactive control decks some strong tools. Honor of Claws filters through your deck while creating card advantage. It effectively draws you three cards in mid to late game. Stormhalt Knife gains you five life in a pinch without losing tempo, it also enables you to play a sweeper and then kill an opposing relic weapon for free. It\u2019s much better than Sword of the Sky King since you\u2019ll have to tank a ton of damage while ramping in the early game.\nPlaying 4 Equivocates and 2 Desert Marshals to counter FJP, which turns out to be one of the best matchups for temporal. As long as you got some ways to deal with Vargo Redclaw, they\u2019re actually pretty light on threats. Equivocate can also blow out Korovyat Palace which is very prevalent at the moment.\nRunning 2 Moondials for some flood protection. and it\u2019s an answer to Auric Runehammer. It\u2019s doing well against grindy three color mid-range decks for me.\nPossible adjustments: If you\u2019re in an aggro meta, consider switching in Defiance, more Stormhalt Knifes and the 4th Hailstorm over some card draw spells. If you find yourself in a lot of control mirror, bring in Eilyn's Choice and possibly Sword of the Sky King. If you\u2019re against a lot of aegis units/ vargos, try out Unstable Form.\nAlthough it\u2019s not the best deck in the format, I had a lot of fun and made master with this deck. Hope you\u2019ll enjoy it too."

Firstly, you want a high density of spells for Diogo to get value, and you want a number of them to be bombs. The same is true when trying to maximize Moment of Creation. The late game option of Xo of the Endless Hoard is a sweet new pickup for FTP Moment as well.\n\nThe spell line-up needs a degree of consideration. Sometimes you will hit Torch off Diogo, which seems bad (and it kind of is). Obviously, we have to play Torch, and if you hit it off Diogo every so often, then that is an acceptable sacrifice we make to play Torch. However, the lack of Seek Power is very intentional. Jennev Cargo can at least be cast for free so we can play the same card we contraband into on that same turn, and Find the Way is a draw-two due to the echo trigger, whereas Seek Power would truly be an awful hit.\n\nThe deck is a ton of fun, but a little hard to play at first. Getting to resolve a huge Diogo is very satisfying however."

        "success": "Ranked up to 1200ish masters at the end of last season. I took a concept from Twitch streamer LocoPojo and adapted it to suit my collection and personal play style. This deck utilizes the new pledge tools to cheat out minions and spells that lead to a lot of card draw, power, and damage. It\u2019s a high roll deck where you live and die by activating your pledge cards. Always mulligan with the intent to pledge, even if you have to go down to 6.\n\nQuestions, thoughts, concerns, let me know!\n\nUpdates: As someone pointed out familiar was kind of a weird pick (which I knew would probably be the case), and after play testing it, i agree it felt underwhelming in this list. I elected to focus on the ramping aspect of this deck and due to some of the high influence costs (Darya and Tempest), trail maker made sense and is some nice fixing. I also swapped out strategize for honor of claws. It feels a lot better to destiny into, and it\u2019s just generally a good card. If you\u2019re running primal I\u2019d encourage you to put HoC in almost any list."

This is assuming you were able to pledge to start.\n\nThis is very much an aggro deck, but it also has sticking power due to card draw from a pumped borderlands scout or from Winter Crown. Zende helps with the late game, bringing back 1-2 units from the void.\n\nMake sure to play your cards in the right order to get the most out of your units.\n\nNot sure what else to say, except that so far this deck is performing well, though not perfect - above 60% and rising as I make changes. Feel free to play around with it and make it better if you can! have fun!"

        "success": "(EDIT: After watching Thatresolves play the deck, I agreed that the power was a bit awkward and that Teacher influence into Ponysnatcher influence was rough. Cut the Dredgers for more Merchants, at which point I stopped seeing the need for Teacher. It was hard. I love Teacher. But as good as it is early, it's pretty underwhelming late, and this deck wants the option to go late to maximize the extra value generated by Glasshopper. He also suggested Rhysta, which I didn't originally consider to be on-plan, but I may have been underestimating how much work pulling a Shadow sigil out can be. Thanks for the advice!)\n\nI know a lot of people were down on the pledge deck, but there is no better feeling than a Moonstone Vanguard in your opening hand with these little Clockroach beauties. Chump them early and let Dread get them back for even more Vanguards. Slap a blade on them for even more Vanguards. Dredge them back for even more Vanguards. Or Cykalis, I'm not picky. What's not to love about Glasshopper?\n\nMull aggressively. You want to Pledge. You need to Pledge. Preferably Moonstone Vanguard. Cykalis is a really good second option. Dread is fine, and you can do some neat stuff with a lot of them, but I'd only pledge one as a last resort.\nIf you can't Pledge, Glasshoppers and Blades are not nearly as cool. If you have enough power that the Pledge unit cost reduction doesn't matter, just throw the Hoppers in the market. Blades are still useful, especially on Cykalis.\nNon-Pledge stuff? Desecrate is so good. Initiation is nice with the amount of recursion in here. Vara is Vara. Teacher might be flex, but I like having another 2-drop with Memory Dredger. Ponysnatcher eats well, either removal or markets.\nThe market needs a better player to make it. I'm testing Apex Predator in there, but I only grab it when I've got multiple Hoppers to put its cost more in line with Carnosaur. Cheaper removal might just be better. And since everything has Time (for now) Auralian Merchant might be better than the Smuggler?"

The deck has a natural four drop now (no more debating on wasting a Parliament), while having smoother ramp overall, especially when your Initiate gets nuked (Power-->Power Stone into Power-->Call for Aid into Ironthorn-->Power into Telut). And finally having a little draw in this deck is clutch in the late game.\n\nSvetya, Merciful Orene feels right at home as another late game threat that adds an alternate win condition when you're in top deck mode (and more Aegis protection against sweepers)."

When I drafted this, I was thinking the elves and the hideaway would be pretty good together, but it was mostly the time cards that carried me in almost all of my wins."

Makto is a resilient threat and wincon in and of himself, especially if he's an 11/11 with Aegis. With less Justice units I have room for more card draw to find and discard either Svetya or Scourge. And with the way my curve is set up currently if I discard a 3 cost card to Whispering Wind I guarantee that I draw either Grasp, Makto, Svetya or Scourge."

        "success": "Third and probably final version of the deck.\nIdea is to push early for damage and finish the game with either Crystallize or Maul. Which one you need will depend on the matchup. For instance:\nPalace control is an instant Maul fetch. That deck has lots of card draw. Two things to take into account: if you get an early merchant, try to push for as much damage as possible pre-turn 5 (harsh rule incoming). Keep if possible an available Equivocate if they have a Vargo Redclaw and they are about to hit turn 6, to Equivocate before it gets the +4+4 aegis. If Maul damage is not enough, you can hold until they get a Xo of the Endless Hoard, and let it attack, so that they draw the treasure troves. That is when you Maul. Finally, one thing to note is that Permafrost will be less reliable post turn 6, so swapping it for somthing in the market is a very valid option.\nAggro decks. Here it will depend on whether or not you managed to keep your units, and how far ahead/behind you are. In a stalled board, you want Crystallize. If you got early presence, and an early merchant, Clock of Stolen Hours is good. If you feel the need to kill something asap, maybe Xenan Initiation is what you need. Keep in mind here, that you can delay playing Teacher of Humility for one turn to play Teacher of Humility with Bear Guard Bayonet, and avoid Torch / Suffocate. Will die to Vanquish now, though.\n\nAs a general rule, you will want to pledge a Cykalis, the Burning Sand, a Moonstone Vanguard and lastly a Shadowlands Borderscout (in that order of preference). This is a GENERAL rule, as you may prefer pledging a Moonstone Vanguard if you already have a Glasshopper against an aggro match up, you may want to pledge to keep the curve as smooth as possible (more than one Moonstone Vanguard or Cykalis, the Burning Sand and Shadowlands Borderscout both in hand). Still, pledging is not compulsory, and if you have a decent hand, you may want to keep it (having more than one card that benefits from pledging in your hand, and being unable to pledge is an instant redraw, though)\nAnother general rule is that, if you pledged a Cykalis, the Burning Sand, you will want to play Dusk Raider BEFORE a Glasshopper, to give the created cykalis berserk (and you almost always want that).\nYou may want to keep an eye open for whether or not you play Teacher of Humility + Bear Guard Bayonet in the same turn (I know i'm repeating myself, but bear with me). To keep in mind: justice will still be able to kill you with both Vanquish and Defiance; shadow will kill you with Annihilate, but not with Suffocate; Torch will no longer be a threat. Plus, Teacher of Humility gets overwhelm, and will most likely trigger its infiltrate if you attack (if you also have Twilight Hunt, you can unleash the wombo combo).\n\nAs side notes, although i do not like Shadowlands Borderscout in general, this deck plays many removal magnets before Shadowlands Borderscout comes into play, vastly increasing its survival chance. Once it's down and ready, this card is a beast, especially combined with one of our relics, or with a possible berserk, or with bear guard bayonet. drawing 4 cards from an atack is beautiful.\n\nMirror Image has earned its place here because most of what you can duplicate has a great added value. Be it a merchant, a Cykalis, the Burning Sand, a Glasshopper, a Dusk Raider, any creature to which you added killer, etc. Still, having two in hand is extremely awkward, so only two in the deck\n\nInitiate of the Sands vs Journey Guide: Initiate of the Sands wins (for me) because of the following: i. it allows a turn two merchant into a turn three Clock of Stolen Hours. ii. it allows a turn two Teacher of Humility + Bear Guard Bayonet. iii. It allows a turn two crest (or other depleted power, remember, turn one you want to pledge) and Dusk Raider. iv. It allows you to push for some (meager, yes, but still non-zero) damage. The only real advantage Journey Guide has (IMO) is not dying to Snowball (being a better blocker is not important, as you will almost always be wanting to atack early).\n\nI think that's all. Only things i'm still testing are the Cobalt Waystone in the market (which I still VERY occasionally need), and the split Permafrost - Equivocate (permafrost less useful against palace control and SST/Moonstone Vanguard). Any idea will be greatly appreciated."

If Ahorn's TJP recurrence succeeds, I'd favor Jotun Hurler at some point for market fodder and pings.\nAll I wanted with this deck is to ramp with pledge synergy to my favorite flashy units atm: Eilyn, the Rising Storm and Apex Predator. Also I tried TJP to incorporate Equivocate into Hooru Pledge earlier, that didn't work well so here I am. Kenna, Shaman of the Scale is cool but rather randomly included. But all in all these big and impactful units really pique my interest.\n\n\n\n\n100% winrate ofc"

And Wisdom of the Elders is great to get some card advantage in the late game.\n\nHonor of Claws and Commando are something of a flex spot - I like what they're doing in terms of life and card advantage and filling out the curve, but I could see moving to more or less of either one, or even cutting some of them for jennev merchants.\n\nSavagery is a great way to get a Vargo out of the way or other units in your way. Also a great way to activate either Feast-Caller or Aniyah on the turn they are played. Just having the overwhelm is very useful for pushing damage and taking down sites with only chump blockers to defend them.\n\nSo far this deck has brought me a winning streak and I hope it does the same for you. Have fun!"

        "success": "Diogo M\u00e1laga, Elonze + Invoke the Waystones\n\nDiogo combo! Plenty of people have been talking about this strategy since Diogo was spoiled, and I've fleshed it out here to a surprising amount of success. Is it good? Ehhhh, I'm not convinced it is once people figure out how to play against it, but it's fun and does have the OTK. I tried a few win conditions but Lumen Reclaimer felt like the best way to not die after drawing through the deck. I also tried Talir's Unwinding with Icicle Marksman but both cards were awful on their own and didn't end up doing a ton of damage together either.\n\nHow the Combo Works\nDiogo gives Invoke the Waystones Destiny, which creates the following loop:\n\n1) Invoke the Waystones is played.\n2) The top 4 cards of your deck are discarded.\n3) The next card is played for free.\n4) Effects from the free card are put on the stack (for cards like Eilyn) or happen immediately (Temple Scribe)\n5) A Destiny'd copy of Invoke the Waystones is drawn\n6) A card is drawn (from Destiny). Repeat from step 2.\n\nSo in essence for every 6 cards in your deck, 4 cards are discarded, 1 card is played, and 1 card is drawn until the deck is exhausted.\n\nHow to play the deck\n\nRedraw for a hand with preferably with Pledge + Diogo. With this configuration of the deck it is imperative to have the Pledge online, and I would even go down to 6 cards looking for it. The first order of business is to find Diogo M\u00e1laga, Elonze and amplify for at least one. Once you have amplified Diogo, you need to either draw Invoke the Waystones naturally (the hard way) or find a Jennev Merchant for Celestial Omen Then, you draw your deck, and are left with no cards in deck and a warning that you're about to lose the game! Fear not, for a Lumen Reclaimer from the market restocks your deck complete with the Destiny'd Invoke the Waystones. From there, you can play units until you have a full board and sacrifice the Lumen Reclaimer to put additional copies in your deck so that you don't just lose. With a full board and the ability to replenish it every turn, you frequently overwhelm your opponent's resources, but you can also win with a huge Temple Artisan with Savagery or with multiple Eilyn shots to your opponent's face.\n\nThe backup plan of Temple Artisan, Eilyn, the Rising Storm, or even just Invoke the Waystones turn after turn can work if the opponent isn't applying ample pressure.\n\nThe Market\n\nDiogo Malaga, Elonze and Celestial Omen\nCombo Pieces\n\nEquivocate\nRemoval for when you need it. Could potentially be replaced by Display of Instinct if you're not worried about Deepforged Plate\n\nLumen Reclaimer\nMain wincon, makes it so that you don't just die.\n\nSavagery\nAlt wincon, when paired with Temple Artisan.\n\nOdds and Ends\n-Always pledge turn 1.\n-Be patient before going for the Omen -> Invoke; if you don't have power up after the Celestial Omen, it is possible to fizzle. The more time you have to set it up, the better.\n-Bear Guard Bayonet on Temple Artisan is pretty good as an alt wincon."

But let's be honest it's Into The Shadows campaign, that you probably already have.\nPower Stone vs Bear Guard Bayonet:\n- Power Stone doesn't require unit to be able to ramp\n- Playing Bear Guard Bayonet on a Ramp unit will result in loosing 2 cards for one removal and get behind on Ramp\n- Power Stone is a relic, so this will result in more consistent buff for Tunneling Gargantua, 12 vs 8\n- You don't want to play Bear Guard Bayonet on Messenger Hawk, coz this unit is a chump blocker and you want to block most damage you can.\n\nDeck Design\n- 26 Units, 14 Pledge, 8 Ramp, 4 Utility\n- 8 Ramp Relics\n- 16 Spells, 4 \"Mass Removal\", 4 Draw, 4 Ramp/Cycling, 4 Utility\n- 25 Power in 2:3 proportion, Primal:Time\n\nGame Plan\nMain goal is to have at least 1 Pledge unit turn 1, you always want to have it and pledge it.\nSecond is that you want your ramp for 2 and for 4.\nIdeally you also want 1 cost card to de played off the pledged unit, Messenger Hawk into Glasshopper.\nSo turn 2 and 3 your ramp Turns, that means that you want to play ramp for 2 to increase your total power:\n- Power Stone - doesn't afraid of unit removal, safer option.\n- Trail Maker - great option due to influence stabilization, remember you need 2 Primal and 3 Time influences.\n- Glasshopper - it's not really \"ramp\" effect, it's a unit cost reduction, it is more viable in cases when you have Moonstone Vanguard or you Pledged it. Coz you can't play 4 cost ramp on turn 3 off the Roach.\nOn turn 3 you want to play your 4 cost ramp:\n- Eternity Core - once again it doesn't afraid on unit removal and it gives +4/+4 to Tunneling Gargantua that can be played on t5-6.\n- Call for Aid - good in all aspects, it ramps, it cycles, it gives life and it is fast.\n\nSo having ramp on t2 and t3 opens us in multiple options, you can refill hand with Honor of Claws and more likely draw into threats or you can apply pressure by playing Moonstone Vanguard or Colossal Pteriax on turn 4.\nThe longer games goes, the more power you will have and more cards will be drawn as well as Glasshoppers that will bring your threats in hand.\n\nYou will be shocked how consistent you can be on ramping plan.\n\nSideboard represents possible cards to replace with:\nPower Stone => Bear Guard Bayonet\nMessenger Hawk => Permafrost\nAdjust your power base according your new rates.\n\nDon't forget to hit that like like button if you liked this deck.\nWrite your feedback, suggestions in comment section."

        "success": "The point of this deck is to get Shard of the Spire out and get value off of it, and to appreciate never-played meme cards of course. Most of the units get hugely buffed from Shard of the Spire.\n\nCopperhall Porter: This guy is just here to trade with aggro and draw you some power. Good candidate for replacement because he honestly doesn't do much. Signal Flare could go here.\n\nRed Canyon Smuggler: One of the ways to get your shard out. Merchants stop you from having dead shards in your hand. If you Rise to the Challenge on her, she will come out as a 4/4 double damage.\n\nRika, Desert Navigator : Shard makes her a 5/5. She can also wear some weapons and still get her warps off if you didn't draw spire.\n\nWinchest Merchant: Just another way to get shard. Not as good as the smuggler.\n\nMomentum Builder : One of the main memes in this deck. Becomes a 10/10 and beyond, and even if you don't have shard you can still put a weapon on it to get it to attack.\n\nShieldsmith : Becomes a decent 5/5 with lifesteal. It's useful for stalling, and it can even attack naturally if your miner's musket dies or you lose armor from waystones.\n\nRobobuddy : Another meme card that is only useful in maybe two decks max, this being one of them. 6/6 charge that creates a 3/3 when it hits. I believe that is the best you will ever get out of this card.\n\nMiner's Musket : There is no real curve in this deck and you will usually be clumsily playing 1 card per turn. This helps with that by making the expensive cards playable, and also giving you something to do early, not to mention trading with aggro units.\n\nOrnate Katana : If you don't get spire, this is one way to make your units actually do something while not losing card advantage.\n\nDoorknocker : Yes for one more power you can just play plate in this deck. But can your plate create a 3/3 double damage on an empty board? Let us not speak of the fact that Twinstrike Master is already a 4/4 double damage for just 1 more power.\n\nDefiance : You desperately need to stop early aggression until you can set up the shenaniganry.\n\nRise to the Challenge : Indirectly gets you shard. Immediately turns on Momentum Builder and Shieldsmith if needed, or otherwise just gets you whatever you need at that moment.\n\n- MARKET -\nVanquish : This is usually to kill some big flyer or other problem unit.\n\nShard of the Spire : The deck is somehow even worse without this.\n\nDeepforged Plate : Overwhelm and endurance are pretty good here.\n\nAmilli, Cloudmarshal : Becomes an 8/8 and deals with fliers, not to mention probably wins the game if he doesn't immediately die.\n\nStormhalt Knife : I believe that this card is busted as heck and sometimes you just need a free 5/5 relic weapon."

This deck tries to leverage The Winter Crown in an aggressive leaning Feln deck, where Haunting Scream works nicely as both burn and a way to trigger Crown when unable to attack on board. Argenport Instigator and Black-Sky Harbinger also allow for triggering Crown without attacking.\n\nDesecrate was also a significant card for this sort of Feln strategy, as it provides another efficient removal spell and allows cutting Permafrost in order to play Vara, Vengeance-Seeker, who otherwise has excellent synergy in the deck."

        "success": "Bear Guard Bayonet playing undepleted power is absurd.\n\nThis should not be a good deck, I just threw together some cards that synergize with the new Homecoming cards. It should probably include some form of interaction like some Enforcers or Blades. However ramping into Korovyat Palace is very effective.\n\n\nEdit: after playing more of this I'm actually convinced it is a good deck (not tournament good, but still good). Its power is far too reliant on your opening hand but it still has game without Hojan + Bayonet openers. I mostly let Chains to carry me to victory, but a 10 attack Silverwing Courier with Berserk is an effective closer.\n\nPledge Cards\nConsidering the importance of Pledge and the available options I think this deck should run 12-16 sources. Aniyah, Arctic Sheriff and Silverwing Courier are pretty solid, leaving the rest to be filled out with Imperial Loyalist, Reyna, the Unwavering, Shadowlands Borderscout, or Eilyn, the Rising Storm. Pledging Justice is usually what you want in order to be able to play Icaria on 2 and hit JJJJJJ quickly using Bayonet. Loyalist and Borderscout are extremely good if you can hit them with Withstand but that is not reliable and they benefit heavily from some other activators in your deck. Reyna is usually just an expensive fat body and Eilyn does not pair well with Whispering Wind (you can't discard her and she reduces the chance of drawing Chains). Personally I find using Loyalist to tutor for Aniyah (Withstand) or a merchant (Mirror Image) quite fun so that's what I've been sticking with.\n\nThe original plan was to use Whispering Wind to tutor for Chains but I've found that it's important enough to just run several main deck. Having multiple Chains out is a great way to really drive a point home."

You definitely have the potential to win with vargo or rizahn + palace, but you should outscale pretty much anything if you can get a svetya down without instantly losing. At that point, even your merchants are 8/8 aegis units, and there are very few decks that can 1 for 1 that sort of card. If you can get a martyr's chains to stick on top of that, it's pretty much guaranteed gg.\n\nSpecific interactions: honor of claws + privilege of rank is amazing. Both cards are worth playing on their own, but if you discard privilege with honor, you get net +3 card advantage for 4 mana, while playing each card individually is net +2 card advantage for 7 mana. If you have both in your hand, passing turn 3 and then discarding privilege on turn 4 with honor is better than playing both on curve, even if you have nothing else to do on turn 3.\n\nVargo ignores harsh rule (including friendly harsh rules). You can potentially force your opponent to overcommit to the board in order to get past vargo and then get an easy 2 or 3 for 1 with harsh rule without killing your own board.\n\nMerchant for stormhalt knife is a staple vs aggro. If the aggro deck can't reduce you below 10 health in a reasonable amount of time, then you should still win despite \"wasting\" your merchant. If they do manage to drop you low, a 0 power 5/5 relic weapon can do a great job of stabilizing you."

Go through 90-100% of your deck, playing a couple of Xo of the Endless Hoard and/or Apex Predator, merchant for Display of Instinct and then Equivocate (if possible) to counter your opponent's next turn. Use Messenger Hawk to replenish your deck to ensure you can play Xos/Predators for the next 4 turns, or Lumen Reclaimer your full Void including multiple copies of Destiny Invoke to combo off again. Use Hawk in the middle of the combo to help hit additional copies of Xo/Predator or Great Valley smuggler to help set up a lethal attack on your next turn.\n\nIf you draw your single copy of Invoke, you can use Messenger Hawk to put 4 more in the deck before playing Diogo.\n\nWhen setting up the combo, remember that Auralian Merchant cannot fetch Resurface, so use it first instead of another merchant in hand to fetch Diogo.\n\nI'm playing Resurface over Celestial Omen in the market to make it easier to protect your tutor from Regent's Tomb/Sabotage as it can be fetched and played at 7 power. Putting Waystones on top instead of drawing it immediately guarantees you will have enough power to merchant for Display of Instinct and can fetch/play Reclaimer if needed at the end of the combo even though you sometimes combo off 1 turn later. I'm not 100% this is correct, but it has felt right so far.\n\nThis deck will fold to a single well-timed Vara's Choice. If Xenan is prominent, a 4 Invoke, 4 Diogo list would be more resilient. Getting Resurface or the first Invoke the Waystones negated is bad news, so play smart if an opponent is holding up power for a negate."

The ceiling is Diogo giving Destiny to End of Hostilities, then tributing Kenna, Shaman of the Scale and filling up your board with Kennas with Destiny End of Hostilities. Otherwise, plays similarly to other Kennadins decks."

This enables some crazy combos as if you use this on an attacking dread it pretty much allows it to always hit face heal and deal damage without dying to a block due to its low defence, and if you give something unblockable later (which kills it after) that's ok too as when you have a killer unit whicjh has used its ability allows you to deliberately send it to the void to buy back and use again, or guarantees a draw from moonstone vanguard etc and I have managed to pull off some crazy combos already by making a vanguard and dread unblockable and looping them in and out of the void\nMarket\nHaven't totally settled on the market choices yet but feel its pretty solid as Xenan temple gives you another killer effect gain some health back for the desecrate and gives some draw as does the Dizos office, there are two sources of modal relic and unit removal spells in banish and passage and the other choice I couldn't decide between Varas choice for removing and silencing a threat or sandstorm scarf to shut down flyers which can be a problem for the deck as this is probably the flex slot for me it can be something else you may feel is needed"

        "success": "2-0 with this deck!!1 felt like posting, might delete later hehe\n\nin all seriousness I wanted to take a shot at putting together a list that tries to take advantage of Svetya, Merciful Orene, Korovyat Palace and the revenge mechanic and this is what I've come up with so far.\n\nMerchants - I initially wanted to run 8 Smuggler/Merchant but the 3-drop slot is a bit packed due to playing Stonepowder Alchemist - also it feels worse without having Xo of the Endless Hoard, however the market is pretty much built to support 8 if you want to try that.\n\nUnit Suite - All of the units are pretty self explanatory in that they synchronize well with Svetya, Merciful Orene and Korovyat Palace. Shelterwing Rider is a card that I've pretty much considered as good as shiftstone since Vara, Vengeance-Seeker was released, but perhaps it can provide value in this theme. Inquisitor Makto is also a card that I've never been too impressed with competitively, but has always been enjoyable for me to build around so we'll see if he ends up being good enough here. Svetya, Merciful Orene is your big payoff card to try and finish games that Palace itself can't.\n\nRemoval Suit - I think the most notable piece of removal here is Auric Runehammer. I think the card is probably a must in this deck in that it answers Vargo Redclaw and is also often a 2-for-1. Other than that, feel free to play around with the amount and selection of removal you want. I don't have too much rhyme or reason as to why I'm playing the numbers of each card.\n\nCard Draw - I want to play more Honor of Claws as it's very good in trying to find revenge units again but I feel that I'm going to be playing other things more often on turn 4 and Palace also allows me to Wisdom of the Elders when I need which is great.\n\nMarket - Market is also pretty self explanatory. Regent's Tomb on 4 (especially on the play) is very strong. I initially had 4 Harsh Rule main deck and Vanquisher's Blade as removal/graveyard hate in the market but I ended up taking them out and just playing 1 in the market. I think this deck has enough units/removal to merit not having to play main deck Harsh Rule."

I'm not certain Azindel is pulling his weight there. Copying Varas and Caiphuses continues to be as good as it ever was.\n\nIf your Severin hits an Amber Ring, look for an opportunity to tutor for a Crystalline Chalice. That is a very powerful value engine.\n\nIf you are seeing a lot of bore, probably bring out the Equivocate or the Azindel and throw an Unseal or Dissociate into the market to deal with it."

When you don't have Privilege to discard, look to use the loot effects to maximize your chances of curving out your fliers.\n\nOnce you're able to curve a Shelterwing Rider or Amilli, Cloudmarshal into Korovyat Palace, the game is pretty much won, even if that's your only unit after a Harsh Rule. Often times just a few small fliers will do the trick when combined with Palace.\n\nThe deck packs plenty of removal (Defiance, Permafrost, Vanquish) as well as an Avigraft and Harsh Rule out of the market for when the AI gets a nut draw.\n\nI am listing this deck as a Work in Progress and am open to suggestions. It has done fairly well for me in my testing so far, but not as well as my conventional build when you factor in that this deck is slower. I think with a few tweaks this deck could have the consistency to be a very strong option for Gauntlet."

Korovyat Palace seems extremely powerful and a great source of card advantage in a longer game, which matches well with our 8-smuggler, 4 Hurler, 4 Xo package. Whether Vargo earns his place here is a big question mark, as is the exact nature of the disruption and draw packages. I am testing the West-Wind Herald combo because it does have the potential to just end games, but I have always been leery of its inclusion. We will see if it earns its place."

That found the odds of having at least 1 pledge card in your hand and 2-3 sigils at around 50%, and you are going to want to use that pledge.\n\nWhy you ask? well read the cards my friend we are here to capitalize off strong pledge cards and Glasshopper, and if for whatever the odds you don't draw a Glasshopper all game it also helps to make an indestructible Silverwing Courier.\n\nNow to attempt to explain all the cards in the deck and why.\n\nCargos and seeks: cuz power fixing and they're the only card draw not off put by Andrik, Renegade Priest.\n\nAnnihilate: cuz removal, it's fast it's nice maybe you want to switch out a vanquish for it? I don't judge.\n\nGlasshopper: The cornerstone of the deck, it's card draw it's ramp it's a body! it's everything fun and creative and a body, depending on who u pledge you might be playing this deck very differently!\n\nVanquish: again removal, it's a little slower, but it helps us deal with big threats without worrying about their factions.\n\nVanquisher's Blade: same deal as Vanquish, but also graveyard hate and a lil extra damage.\n\nDisplay of Vision: mana fixing that maybe you'll get to use the other 2 modes on who knows what the meta is gonna be?\n\nHidden Road Smuggler: cuz smuggling, only running 4 smugglers because they don't synergize with Andrik, Renegade Priest very well.\n\nValkyrie Enforcer: a silencing 3/3 flier in a primarily justice deck? yes please! also it's good with Andrik, Renegade Priest, and Telut, Queen's Hand\n\nAndrik, Renegade Priest: my boy and my inspiration, cuz his primary ability hates on merchants and control, and his secondary ability synergizes with Telut, Queen's Hand for extra big face damage (assuming you aren't swinging with Andrik himself)\n\nCykalis, the Burning Sand my other boi, aces face hates on sites and Glasshopper makes him cost 3!\n\nMoonstone Vanguard: cuz card draw and life and pledge, be careful with him if Andrik, Renegade Priest is on the board too.\n\nSilverwing Courier: cuz flying indestructible pledge! he's a hard to kill boi making him great with Telut, Queen's Hand, he's still weak to plenty tho, but he'll pull out their harder removal.\n\nReyna, the Unwavering: Ms. hard to kill ya can't Permafrost me! good at staying on the board as a blocker and a body with Telut, Queen's Hand. I honestly might increase the # of her because she's fun and u don't see her often.\n\nTelut, Queen's Hand: cuz wincon.\n\nquick market rundown: power cuz power, slay cuz removal, tomb cuz good card, sword cuz life steal and occasionally aegis, and lastly chains cuz extra wincon.\n\nI really think this deck could be competitively viable, and if not it sure as heck is fun, because as long as you draw your Glasshopper the deck is going to play different depending on what you pledged. Also this deck might switch, market power for Burglarize"

Use your combat trick finest hour to activate Hojan and re-up everyone's empower, and don't be afraid to commit hard to the board state.\n\nSiraf's beacon is a really good card and should be played on 3 when possible, it's a free empower activation when the conditions are right and since most of our units are small it should be easy to avoid most removal (or at least the opponent loses tempo in doing so).\n\nAndrik is a real show stopper here, that +4/2 is truly amazing. Just make sure to work your market before you drop him else you commit to not using the market while he is out (or at the very least you aren't going to be able to play anything turn of market pull).\n\nMost of the units are just good units on curve, nothing too special. Everything works together great and currently I am skyrocketing through the ranks playing this.\n\nEnjoy!"

        "success": "Edit/Update: After some edits from looking at Batteriez deck, I've gone 15-5 with this deck and hope to ride it to Masters so I can go back to inventing more :)\n\nA few notes about the changes:\n\nDistrict Infantryman: Not bad in the opening hand, but I always wanted to fetch grenadins and honestly this deck doesn't want as many 1-drops.\n\nSecret Passage: I still love it so I kept in 1. It's a good way to still sack cards from Madness, put through a revenge unblockable unit, hit with a unit to allow Camrin to grow, or deliver finishing blows, but you want more units first and desecrate is still more valuable in general. I could see bringing it back up to 2, but unsure what to cut.\n\nPiercing Grief: Save this if possible on turn 4 with Ashara Ruthless Assassin out for a nasty surprise. Best with a torch or combust etc in hand as well. Overall this has performed very well.\n\nTripwire Grenadin: Upped this to 4 due to its versatility - kill Hojans or Scorpians, pump Camrin, deal that extra damage plus torch to kill Vargo.\n\nStonepowder Alchemist: A weaker addition, honestly, mainly because the 3 slot is clogged since I prefer Ashara Ruthless Assassin in this deck (my unique inclusion vs other similar decks) so this is my cut. That being said, the lifesteal can be useful and occasionally key.\n\nWhispers of the Void: This has won me a couple of the longer games. Infinite ways to pump Camrin or Ashara and inevitability. Can't be effected by opponent shutting off the void (other than being able to grab the Tormentor with DoA\n\nRegent's Tomb: Honestly, cutting this and replacing it with Highwayman was one of the best things I did. Nothing about Regent's Tomb is inherently bad except that it doesn't actually match this deck's tempo. It's a card that wants to sit back and fulfill its agenda to be really useful. You want to win before then.\n\nVicious Highwayman: Best new inclusion - great for the games when behind on life or when the board is cleared and you need a charge unit.\n\nOverall, this new iteration has performed great. Very fun and I hope others give it a try!\n\n-----------------------------------------------\n\nI know Camrin isn't the best or most exciting card from the new set, but I wanted to try her anyways.\n\nAnd I got surprised - the deck is actually pretty good and fun to play. So far, after the campaign, aggro is actually in a good spot because many others are playing control with maybe one unit (Vargo). Madness is great in this situation.\n\nA couple tips from playing with Camrin - it's best to play her after you've attacked and gone through so you can immediately pump her to a 5/5 out of torch range.Your deadly units and Ashara are great at setting up situations where this is the case. Also, her plus Madness as as good as it sounds, since the sacrifice doesn't cost anything, so it's easy to set up with other spells etc. I've even considered putting Forge Wolf in as a fetchable for Press-Gang due to the fact that it can immediately pump Camrin and draw you an extra card. Camrin's Card Draw plus Display of Ambition keep your aggro hand relatively full, which is a plus.\n\nOther than that, this is a pretty standard Madness deck. Hope you enjoy it!"

The combo is to use your Governor to sacrifice a relic, and since the pit is your only relic in the deck, it will always find that. To do that you need relics from other sources, and this deck has 13 options. Two new cards from homecoming, call for aid and severin the mad, and then you have mesmerized moth and a rat cage in your market as a cheap search target. There are plenty of flex slots available as this is my first draft, but results have been good so far."

The idea of the deck came around when I realized both cards want to sacrifice and Scavenge exists.These two cards combo with Madness, Rolant's Memorial, and tokens and feel so good to go off with.\n\nRolant's Memorial is a really fun win condition. Slightly inconsistent but extremely satisfying to play.\n\nOf course Red Canyon Smuggler is a win condition by herself with Deepforged Plate.\n\nOtherwise, the deck plays as you would expect from a mashup of Haunted Highway/Burn Queen.\n\nNumbers on the cards is still iffy. Display of Ambition is great but drawing too many early can kill all momentum. Combust and Devour are at 2 since Ashara and Camrin act as sudo-removal with madness already and we're running 4 Quarry. Market cards are definitely up for debate.\n\nThis shell feels like it is exactly where Camrin, the Fox belongs."

The 8 smugglers are very powerful and even better they give you access to Tomb and Maiden in the market, both of which can be game-winning by themselves. Quarry is ridiculously good here, giving a second way to get free Privilege of Rank casts as well as letting you slam an early Svetya, Rizahn, or Amilli. It's possible that the vanquishes should be slays, but I'mliking the split for now. No Xo's for market abuse feels a little bad, but having more threats we can cast makes it worth it I think. So far I've really been liking the deck, and resolving Svetya continues to be one of the most powerful things you can do in the game right now."

Obelisk buffs all allies and Courtier helps maximize it\u2019s potential. Added Star-reader recently, he can be powerful later in game, also spelunker and smuggler both get buffed fairly quickly by having a relic equipped. Spelunkers ultimate can be a great combo with rat cage equipped & star-reader in grave yard. Smuggler can fetch some pretty powerful cards in black market, my favorite is Nightmaw when I have a field full of 5/5 rats and they all become unblockable. Cleaver with 7 power is also powerful, specially if you use Dark Return and get to reuse killer ability.\n\nStill tweaking this deck. I\u2019m playing Homecoming campaign and aim to add Severin the mad mage in this deck once I unlock him, I\u2019m expecting this to be one of the missing links to this deck, just synergizes so well that it\u2019s like a gift from developers to me! \ud83d\ude04\n\nSideboard:\n\u2022 Elvish Swindler would be a perfect fit for this kind of deck, you can swap Chalice for him to help you amass a rat army quicker. Another good combo is using him to fetch secret passage to get an unblockable kill.\n\u2022 Equivocate was my original removal spell, I swapped it with scorpion wasp, there\u2019s pros and cons to either option."

        "success": "An updated version of the deck I used to take down the community championship. It's been performing extremely well on ladder as well, especially against top-tier decks like FJS midrange, as well as most variants of aggro.\n\nCurrent Rank: Top 25 (Climbed from rank ~250 to top 25 in 2 days)\n\nI haven't changed much from my invitational version, but the few changes are fairly important, so I'll give a short explanation of the thought process behind them.\n\nMarket Changes:\nFirst off, one of the biggest issues for the deck has been Deepforged Plate. Because of that, I really wanted to find a way to fit Bore into the market. Not only is bore a good answer to plate, it also answers cards like Permafrost and Eternity Core, and it has amazing synergy with all of our merchants and Strategizes. Of course, this meant that we had to switch to a mono-fire market, at which point Torrential Downpour needs to come out too. This isn't as much of a problem as it might seem, since downpour was never that useful for me unless I had at least 1 Howling Peak Smuggler in play. The fact is that with Snowball, Torch, Heart of the Vault, and Amaran Stinger, we have a lot of ways to deal with swarms of tiny units. I also don't think that Bore and Kaleb's Choice are both needed in the market, so I replaced Kaleb's Choice with Urn of Choking Embers. Urn is a massive boon to the highway matchup - it's even better than downpour most of the time.\n\nMaindeck Changes:\nThe maindeck changes are mostly a consequence of the market changes. Obviously, we have to take out the Great Valley Smugglers and replace them with Ixtun Merchants. Past that, I also added a 3rd copy of Jotun Hurler, as we're relying more heavily on snowballs now that we don't have downpour in the market. I took out a copy of Display of Instinct for the hurler, as display was consistently my worst card in the championship. 4 damage for 3 power is not a good rate, and holding up a counterspell that costs 3 power is rarely feasible. I do still like the card because of how versatile it is, as well as the situational lifegain it grants, so I think 3-of is the sweet spot.\n\nStrengths:\n- Favored against FJS (~60% at least)\n- Favored against most aggro variants thanks to all the removal + anti-aggro units (stinger, SST, hurler, HoV)\n- Counterspells for Temporal/Reanimator\n- VALUE!\n\nWeaknesses:\n- Low on hard removal, so you can get overwhelmed by beefy time units\n- Low on answers to giant units (Deepforged Plate, Mystic Ascendant, etc)\n- Somewhat low on finishers, though aggressive lines of play + burn is almost always good enough\n\nEdit I:\n-1 Permafrost\n+ 1 Jotun Hurler\nWith all the Hojan Hooru decks running around, I wanted to max out on snowball value. Snowballs also tend to get better in multiples. Although permafrost is a stellar removal spell, it gets hard countered by the new hooru site. I think 3-of is a safe spot to be in.\n- 1 Urn of Choking Embers\n+ 1 Kaleb's Choice\nI've been really missing the counterspell in the market, so I wanted to find a way to get Kaleb's Choice back in. Urn has been pretty useless to me as I have not seen a single highway deck on ladder, so it was a fine card to cut."

Play power(s), pump, attack, smash... it's glorious.\n- Andrik is great is this style of deck. His cost increase ability helps stall the opponent while his other ability pumps our dudes for extra damage.\n- The units all ramp hard so play this like an aggro deck and push damage.\n- Serene Militant fits into this deck very well also.\n- Andrik + Worldbearer = nuts\n\n**WARNING > These guys will knock opponent's teeth out"

It was built to battle the top decks in the format by incorporating a lot of Silencing creatures that can later jump in for 6 or more damage holding either blade.\n\nIt is critical to get to 3 power and 2 Justice quickly. The deck can usually stabilize around that Power with the abundance of 2 and 3 drop creatures that need to be dealt with and have other effects on the board. The Empowered creatures and those with Reknown contribute to the multidimensional way that the deck wins. The win usually occurs off Empowering from a sigil that was magically crafted.\n\nAt times you struggle to get a single creature to stay on the board. And when you do, thern you land Telut. Or, you hand it one of the swords. Hijab or Icarus usually carry them.\n\n(No guarantees regarding this new format.)"

Bayonet with Hojan is a double ramp and the overwhelm is very relevant on him. Sharpshooter warhelm creates big threats off the top. Gunrunner giving your whole side of the board quickdraw lets you get past most boards. Permafrost might be better than display but the versatility is nice. Courier is the worst card but getting pledge is that important. Smuggler for plate is the go-to market, but both sites are situationally great, too."

I won't claim the list is optimally tuned and I'd be willing to bet that you can find a better list out there but this is definitely consistent and enjoyable for me. The Memory Dredger tech in this deck is the strongest attribute but you can easily win with just playing small, threats and Vara, Vengeance-Seeker as well. Shadowlands Tyrant is lots of fun and obviously lives more frequently than it would in ranked but if you're working with a budget it can easily be replaced with something else. I think Impending Doom should probably be in this list but I don't have any. Hope you guys enjoy."

        "success": "Goal of the deck is simple: Control the board until you get a bear down, then continue controlling the board.\n\nNotable cards in the deck:\n4x Permafrost used to be 4x Eilyn's Choice but I ended up wanting more proactive and cheaper cards on ladder when coming up against more and more aggro decks.\n\n4x Hailstorm - Just say no to aggro. Also kills almost all the merchants in the format right now.\n\n4x Jotun Feast-Caller - I wanted another \"threat\" other than just the bear and while Feast-Caller doesn't survive through Harsh Rule like the bear. I found it works really well with Korovyat palace (and we already know it works well with peak).\n\nPower in the market - First the Hooru Banner fixes if you are missing your 3rd color no matter which smuggler goes and gets the power. Second, this is a control deck so missing a power drop on any turn really hurts your game plan and this market power lessens the possibility of that happening. Third, and connected to the second point, the power in the market makes a lot more opening hands keep-able when you can trade off your Xo (or whatever) for a power on turn 3. I have always been a fan of power in markets, and especially in control decks running 8 merchants.\n\nA note on the mirror match:\nBecause your main way of controlling the board is by harsh ruling it over and over again, you are in an awkward situation if the opponent has a bear of their own. In these situations it is important to hold onto your torches to combine them with either more torches, hailstorms, or Howling peak smugglers to remove the bear. In the mirror match, an uncontested bear usually wins so you always have to be playing around how you will deal with a bear from the other side and how to protect your own bear."

Glasshoppers will give you more pledge cards at a reduced cost. Ultimately you can ramp into Eiylin or apex predator. This list is not optimized, maybe you all have some suggestions but it definitely works. Thinking another copy of Eiylin would be good but I don't have 2 haha."

Currently:\n1) Martyr's Chains: the strongest relic in the game\n2) Pit of Lenekta: the next best\n3) Azindel's Gift: especially early on, can destroy an opponent\n\nThe Strategizes are there to put any of those relics that we draw naturally back into the deck.\nThe remaining cards either try to get us more power, create relics to be fodder, or serve as removal. Now the balance on that removal may need tweaking. Vara's Choice and Feeding Time are both great answers to Vargo. I suppose so is Display of Knowledge. But not running Stray into Shadow in the Market (or main?) might just be wrong. We shall see, I suppose.\n\nThe \"Sideboard\" is cards I either have or am still considering for flex spots."

Then you draw another copy, also with destiny, and play that, and so on until you're milled and means to an end kills the opponent. Note that I don't gave any copies of Invoke or Means to an End and I'm f2p so I'd appreciate it if someone tested it before me and gave feedback. You set up the combo with second sight into diogo amplify so you need to hit 8 power."

Still, the concept feels strong.\n\nPermafrost is not very good in the current metagame, but this deck still wants it to press damage through, even if only for a turn. The combination of aggressive 3-drop fliers, backed up by the robust late-game of Amilli, Cloudmarshal and Korovyat Palace, feels very strong. Resolving Sack the City on a board of fliers is pretty disgusting.\n\nShelterwing Rider has been missed, but it is excellent in this deck. The Palace can restore Aegis, giving you a huge threat that can threaten lethal with the follow-up berserk.\n\nMain concerns are the saturation of cards at the 3-drop slot and the lack of good two-drops. Dusk Raider is acceptable, and giving berserk to your aggressive units is nice, but it still feels lacking. Overall, the deck feels strong, and a good blueprint on what might be strong in the new meta."

        "success": "Pretty rough draft but I've been having good success with it so far. Pretty much a generic midrange deck that emphasizes sites. You basically just don't die and keep some units on board long enough to play and complete sites, crushing them in value.\n\nBetween all the midrange-y units, Slay, and Defiance it's pretty easy to protect the sites. And either site is capable of winning you the game if it sticks, although the Palace is obviously the best for that. Tomb is more to distract/soften them up.\n\nTomb is a really nice stepping stone to Palace. It finishes on turn 6 if you play it on 4 and it sticks, and the revenge is nice to get more value out of all the unit buffs on Palace. And of course the power from Lingering Influence helps get you there.\n\nPalace is pretty nuts when you have units, but even if you don't just drawing two cards and distracting them for a turn is worth a lot of the time. Especially if you have Harsh Rule from the market. But other than Wisdom all the agenda cards need a unit so watch out for that. Having every agenda card hit a good target is a very good way to win games.\n\nThe rest is pretty standard, it's just valuable units/recursion to gum up the board while we wait for sites. Pacifier has been great with all the Ixtun/Rakano/Skycrag decks running around. Harbinger has been great as usual. Amilli has been better than Makto ever was. He's a one card wincon that gums up the board and leaves leftover units, basically perfect for the deck.\n\nI think the deck could make great use of 1-2 Dizo's office as well, but again I'm not sure what to cut.\n\nYou could also try running the Argenport Smuggler instead, but Defiance and the Sites being in the main and Market has been straight gas. Also the extra flying blocker/threat has been super nice."

More importantly, it's a lot of fun and refreshing.\n\nThis is combining the new pledge focused cards Glasshopper and Bear Guard Bayonet with Severin, the Mad Mage to build your board at a discount. Since Glasshopper on its own is a bit weak, I have been digging out the good oldClockroach.\n\nJust make sure you pledge something on turn one (the deck still works if you don't but you have no free units or sigil so you are losing some momentum). Each pledge unit has already proven to be really useful, even Heirloom Seeker. The relics fromSeverin, the Mad Mage are even more free actions and Shadowlands Borderscout is just absurd once obelisk is out.\n\nThe market probably needs some work but, to be honest, I generally just grab the two obelisks.\n\nDon't hesitate to make suggestions in the comments. I am still new to Eternal so this deck is probably a bit naive on higher ranks (I am gold, just arrived in diamond but with another one of my pre-campaign brews)."

I played a couple games, won, and got excited about the idea.\n\nVargo is a great weapon carrier due to his ability, so Doorknocker and Plate is a deadly combo and both decent to good on their own. Harsh ruling with Vargo on the field is fun and crushing for you opponent. Giving him endurance through Korovyat Palace breaks off permafrosts and gives him +4/+4 and aegis (to protect from Equivocate/Teleport) and/or berserk. Kaleb's choice protects him from Runehammer. If you see more equivocate, you could swap Choice with Unseal, though obviously only one set of smugglers can fetch it.\n\nDoorknocker is nice because it can be played after a harsh rule to still threaten the board and it can be fetched along with runehammers or plate with Display of Honor or reforge to have a cute 3/5 DD Helpful Doorbot. Svetya it great at stalling their interaction when she comes out, so she is also safe for a turn to put weapons on. I finished one game with her with plate, doorknocker, and pumped by Display of Honor to deal 28 overwhelm damage for lethal.\n\nFun deck and fun new card. Hope you enjoy!"

The Direfang Spiders from Arachnophobia and Miris Nightshade work well with Memory Dredger. Miris Nightshade's Nyctophobia also combos well with Profane Censer, Black Iron Manacles, and Encroaching Darkness.\n\nUpdated the deck a bit. Found that putting a Cowardice on the computer's Copperhall Shieldman or Dune Phantom is particularly entertaining.\n\nBeen playing this quite a bit lately, it's had some 7-0 gauntlet runs, I've also had it get shut down on the first match against an agro/burn deck."

I really think that people are sleeping on Bear Guard Bayonet, so I'm trying to incorporate it into a little bit more aggressive variant. The idea here is that we use Bear Guard Bayonet and Hojan, Crownbreaker to help us reach the top end more consistently or a little faster.\n\nSwapped in Gunrunner as the deck consistently hits 5 power and I think I can get more value out of gunrunner especially when combined with palace.\n\nXo of the Endless Hoard has worked out quite well as a finisher being able to capitalize on the early game pressure put on by Hojan, Crownbreaker.\n\nChunk Chunk seems like he might actually be stronger than Aniyah, Arctic Sheriff currently as when played on curve his stun will naturally wear off about when opponents play Korovyat Palace where as Aniyah, Arctic Sheriff will likely have just started.\n\nCurrently working on figuring out how to handle the mirror where opponents get down a Vargo Redclaw and may replace something in the market for Mortar.\n\nI'll do more of a writeup once I've got it working comfortably.\n\nI've been running 4 of each crest today and liked the results. Haven't really missed plays and being able to control the topdecks has been huge. Bear Guard Bayonet really helps guaruntee a lot of power, and functions almost as well as seek power for controlling some fixing. Going to stick with Crests for the near future."

Tavrod pulling Divining Rod is always really sweet. The deck should probably have 4 Crownwatch Traitor or 4 Kurtarr, but I'm not sure which is better at the moment. If the Combrei merchant had endurance, this deck would definitely get a big leg up."

Then I'll address some of the points that I'm not so high on, and what could be done to fix those.\n\n- Defiance\nDefiance is the only real answer to amaran stinger. That alone makes it worth including. It's also a great answer to any aggro deck, as well as merchants. However, it's a reactive removal spell as opposed to a proactive one. This means that you can't respond to something like Palace's buff by killing the unit, which is a large downside. I think 3-of is a good spot, given the wealth of anti-aggro removal this deck already has.\n\n- Strategize\nWith all the fate cards we play strategize is essentially a 2-cost wisdom of the elders. Always play 4 copies.\n\n- Smugglers\nThese are the best smugglers in the game, so definitely play 4 of each.\n\n- Vargo\nVargo is a great combo with harsh rule, and is just a good unit in general. He's not on the level of Vara or SST, but he's good enough for our purposes.\n\n- Harsh Rule\nAmazing combo with Vargo, just a good card in general for catching us back up.\n\n- Jotun Hurler\nGood anti-aggro, pops aegis, card advantage with strat/smugglers. What's there not to like?\n\n- WWH\nA good 5-drop, which is something these xo midrange decks tend to lack. Also has the potential to just \"oops, I win\" with the market scattershot\n\n- Howling Peak vs Korovyat Palace\nHowling peak has mirror image, palace has withstand. Peak has kaleb's choice, palace has wisdom. But where peak has gun down, arguably the most important spell in its repertoire, Palace has garbage. Palace is a good card, and has utility for punishing permafrost and just beating down, but peak is the better maindeck card by far.\n\n- Xo\nNever less than 4 xo.\n\nStrengths:\n- Near-infinite value, similar to FTP\n- Harsh Rule to reset the board\n- \"oops, I win\" combo of WWH + Scattershot\n- Decent answers to Amaran Stinger\n- Great against aggro\n\nWeaknesses:\n- peak is a clunky card\n- vargo is not the greatest 4-drop, herald is not the greatest 5-drop\n- can get overwhelmed by fatties if you don't find removal in time"

Combust is, as usual, one of the MVP's, and Casualties of the Cause from Homecoming seems to a valuable addition with similar synergy. Camrin fits into this gameplan nicely, as well as providing extra juice for the late game, letting you really turn games around. Madness is amazing and can singlehandedly win games, but you don't need me to tell you that.\n\nWith regards to synergies geared towards Camrin, the deck includes Secret Passage to help her meet her conditions and Kerendon Merchant works well with her, often being a card your opponent won't enjoy blocking. The small revenge package of Piercing Grief and Stonepowder Alchemist are good cards in general, but work especially well with the sacrifice synergy, and both help with health gain. In quite a few games, I've gone below 5 health only to be pulled back by clutch healing from them.\n\nHojan, Crownbreaker is mostly just here as a good card, but can have his renown activated by both Casualties and Obsidian Armor if necessary. In the same category is Regent's Tomb, which is just generally good, and the Sabotage effect is invaluable against some decks.\n\nThis is quite a janky deck, but it's performing decently in casual, and it's very fun to play, regardless of quality. If you try it, please tell me if you enjoy it. Also feel free to comment if you made any changes, and tell me if they work well. I'm always interested in feedback. Cheers!"

The difference between mine and Sunnys version is that im not going all in on the invoke the waystones plan hence why only 1 in the market. The Decks trying to cheat out Witching hour or Aid of the hooru as its main gameplan by discarding anyone of those cards excavating it to the top then amplyfying diogo.\n\nWays to combo:\n\nMaster cartographer or Honor of claws - discard spell...excavate spell to the top same turn you amplify diogo\n\nor\nWest wind herald discarded spell\n\nIf your running into alot of harsh rules you wanna go the invoke the waystones route as no deck can grind you through that. you market for invoke discard it excavate to the top then diogo...next turn you draw your entire ddeck completely till you have around under 3 cards make sure you have lumen reclaimer already in your hand before doing this or a merchant or you risk losing the game. Market for lumen reclaimer and reshuffle to avoid dying. This deck needs a bit of tuning but its alot of fun to play. let me know your thoughts guys and any suggestions on improvements. Also one important thing is to try and mulligan into a pledge card on your first turn as it gives you more value out of the glasshopper and is actually relevant in games going the late game...you literally have 8 copies of the pledged card."

This deck is not, but it gets close.\n\nTo get the obvious out of the way: This is a meme deck. I mean look at it! But it actually got me through Gauntlet a couple of times and somehow works out in Casual as well.\n\nLet me get to the Strategy:\n\nWump, Party Starter is obviously the heart of this deck and Messenger Hawk, Mirror Image, Sudden Schism and Quicksilver Mirror are here to kick of literal landslides of furry monsters and their cold, hard snowballs into the enemy's face.\nWith around 10% of the main deck being Wump or Merchants, you should be able to play Wump by turn 3 or 4.If it takes longer, you should be able to stall somewhat awkwardly. Once Wump is out, try to copy him as fast as possible, so that the enemy has a hard time to remove all that fur from the board. Spiritward Shaman may help you stop the odd spell or curse aimed at your or Wumps shaggy little heads.\nAvigraft and Rain of Frogs are your biggest threats here. Luckily, you are playing a Primal deck and have Cobalt Waystone, Eilyn's Favor and the Shaman to protect you somewhat reliably.\nThe rest of the deck is designed either to stall, build on Wump's Yeti-bonus. Infiltrate automatically when played after Wump and most importantly, draw cards so you can Wump faster and harder.\n\nA few tricks:\nIf you have a copying spell and a merchant on your hand, get the Shaman from your market, copy the merchant and get some Wump.\nRemember that you can proc Infiltrate with Wumps ability.\nJusta, Regglar Jotun can be hit by one of your own snowballs.\n\nI am still unsure about putting Mating Call in here, as it disappointed me most of the time. The Sidedeck cards are all viable copy-cards, though I like to stay with the classics."

        "success": "I wanted to mess around with the new cards from Homecoming to see if the support that Pledge got will make it viable. I chose TJP as my shell because while Primal doesn't really have the same powerful Pledge units that the other factions have, I think Korovyat Palace is an absolute bomb of a card so I wanted to include it. In many ways this deck takes some inspiration from the old 4 Peaks Jennev Midrange deck and its game plan is mostly similar: cycle through your deck and develop your power base early while answering early threats from the opponent, and then close out the game with the deck's powerful and efficient units.\n\nSome notes on the deck\nAniyah, Arctic Sheriff: Aniyah can be a really strong card, but this deck lacks the ability to trigger her Renown apart from Palace, therefore I'm only running 2 copies of her. As a Pledge unit, I think she's too good not to include, but this is something to keep in mind. Jamming in extra spells or weapons didn't seem worth it to me, but if you really dislike not being to Renown her you could possibly fit Sword of Unity in somehow, although you'd probably have to cut Hooru Pacifier to do that.\n\nKorovyat Palace: I think this card is extremely strong, possibly on the same power level as Howling Peak. Right now I'm testing out 3 in the maindeck and 1 in the market, but there's the potential that just one in the market could be sufficient.\n\nSandstorm Titan: Not including Titan is probably a mistake and its likely just a better inclusion than Pacifier, but I have to see how I like Pacifier before I come to my decision.\n\nThe market is the part of the deck that I'm least happy with. Switching to just one copy of Palace in the market lets you run Great Valley Smuggler instead of Jennev Merchant and opens up some additional options to consider in the market (like the Sword of Unity I mentioned above). There's also a chance that this could be an 8 merchant deck, although I'd only consider that if I end up cutting the maindeck Palaces.\n\nI'm sure this deck will need some tweaking as I start to figure out its strengths and weaknesses, but so far it's been very fun to play."

        "success": "This is my first time posting any brews so I apologize if I leave anything important out.\n\nThe goal of this deck is to survive the early game against aggro with removal and the early blocker Glasshopper which also generates significant value with its summon ability. The midgame is the time to stabilize/win game with the threats of Sandstorm Titan , Severin, the Mad Mage, and Moonstone Vanguard. The late game is almost a sure win with Apex Predator and Quicksilver Mirror providing a huge amount of value.\n\nThis deck is extremely good at generating value so trading deficits when stabilizing are often ok.\n\n\nNotable Cards:\nGlasshopper : The start of the deck. Originally the deck was a spam of weak pledge minions, but I realized this card can be so much more useful in a shell with less but high impact pledge units. Great early blocker and the cost reduction is incredibly useful especially for stabilizing against aggro.\n\nBear Guard Bayonet : Surprisingly decent card. Plays the power undepleted so its incredibly powerful and efficient ramp. In games where you miss pledge on turn 1 it's bad but not unplayable\n\nDisplay of Knowledge : The card that supports throwing random relics in the deck. It's great for surprising blockers, drawing into that Xenan Obelisk or Eye of Winter , or yeeting an attacker into the nether realm.\n\nCall for Aid : Very powerful fast speed ramp card, but it's a bit awkward. The 4 drop slot is pretty saturated, but the effect is powerful and the ramp is significant. This card is very welcome late game as this deck doesn't usually reach 9 power for Apex Predator . Edit: too slow for this deck\n\nApex Predator : The level 99 Chad boss of the mafia. Endurance, Killer, Ambush, and Pledge make this card insane if you can play it. Killer + Endurance allows it to kill and then block in the upcoming turn.\n\nQuicksilver Mirror : Extremely powerful but kind of slow. The discount it gets from Severin, the Mad Mage is great and is what got its place in the market over Azindel, Revealed . This card is great at breaking board stalls especially if you have units with killer. Doesn't seem too necessary for the deck. Mirror image could just be better\n\nSeverin, the Mad Mage : Arguably the best card in this deck. The discounts are extremely relevant for all relics, especially for the activables like the rings and Eye of Winter\n\nThis deck is extremely rough so any input is welcome. All of the cards in the deck work decently, but I'm not sure what exactly are the weaker links.\n\nEdit: This deck really relies on a decent midgame so I put in Initiate of Sands to ramp through the early game and took out Hailstorm and Call for Aid"

(I refuse to craft a fourth copy of something in the new set because then I'll def pull it from a pack.)\n\nHaven't had any problems activating pledge in a pleasant way. Anything is a viable pledge target but Cykalis is probably the best. A turn two glasshopper into a turns 3 and 4 Cykalis is pretty amazing. Teacher and Ponysnatcher are removal magnets.\n\nI only have one Xenan Temple which is why its in the market but it has great synergy with Dread. I pulled a Heart of the Vault from my void last game.\n\nStar-Reader's Blade is great on any of the units but prob best on the Glasshopper.\n\nWent with the smuggler instead of Kerendon Merchant so that when I ponysnatch I have more chances I'll be able to play it. But the merchant's body is way more useful so we'll see.\n\nWould love to hear how the deck treats you and how you improve upon it! Have fun!"

I might want more once the meta settles. Haven't run into a Teacher yet but the goal was to refine numbers of new cards.\n\n8 Merchants: Pretty self explanatory. The Market itself is pretty adjustable. I've won more games with a t5 Telut than anything else.\n\nHowling Kurturr: This card is really medium, but it's a dual faction pledger that plays really nice with new Svetya, Telut, and Courier\n\nLoyal Falcon: Purely an experiment as it's a Justice Pledger with a big butt and Endurance. Have not played it once.\n\nSilverwing Courier: This card has vastly over performed. Baby Icaria can push him out of torch range in the event you don't hit a lledge turn 1. Plays nicely with Telut and Svetya. Favorite play pattern is Merchant on 3, Tomb on 4, sabo any non dmg removal, slam Courier.\n\nHarsh Rule: It's possible for decks to go under you. It's never really a dead card because you can market it away.\n\nReyna the Unwavering: Another over performer and I suspect this card had been \"unlocked.\" She is bigger than most units, and is pretty durable.\n\nRelia: Just one of my favorite cards. She has won me a game or two but is peobably just not good enough.\n\n[]New Svetya:[/i] Great card to ramp in to and unloocks the whole deck.\n\nSwaps I'm Debating:\n\nLoyal Falcon vs Marley\nRelia va Amilior Makto\nNumber of Defiance vs Loyal Falcon\nSome others I will update later if I remember."

Same kind of general idea of Highway, in that we are using a lot of high impact cheaper threats, but obviously without the recursion possibilities. Instead we try to generate card advantage with Highland Sharpshooter, and ramping out with Hojan.\n\nRight now I think the ixtun control decks smash this because of how great they seem to be against aggro, but I'm saving this as a reminder in case the meta changes. (Maybe I'm just unlucky and they always have the removal they need :b)"

        "success": "I tend to build my Midrange Gauntlet decks using a very linear shell: 8 1- or 2-Drops, 8 3-Drops, 8 4-Drops, 4 5-Drops, 4 6-Drops, and 4 each of Card Draw, Fixing, Market and Unit Removal, with the remainder of the deck filled with whatever I think the deck can use. With that in mind, I thought I would go over the card choices here:\n\n2-Drops\nBlackhall Warleader and Stormtamer Operative: Warleader is a really good option in a Midrange deck that, while it has really solid choices along the curve, could use a couple extra stats on its units. Stormtamer Operative is one of those cards that takes advantage of a blind spot with the AI: It doesn't take it's ability into account before using removal. It will continually try and Torch 3-health units. It will continually try to ping 1-health units with Temper and Vara's Favor. It's ridiculous the amount of work Operative does just by sitting on the board.\n\nOther Choices: Dusk Raider, Fenris Nightshade, Kerendon Steward, Ripknife Assassin, Tavia, Lethrai Raidleader, Twilight Raptor\n\n3-Drops\nRhysta, Acantha's Herald and Skycrag Scalebreaker: Rhysta is an aggressive early game unit that also helps with Fixing. The weapon Scalebreaker creates can either be used as Market fodder, or attached to a unit to give it evasion (Warleader is a nice option).\n\nOther Choices: Auric Interrogator, Gorgon Fanatic\n\n4-Drops\nRindra, the Duskblade: A staple in this slot in a lot of Feln Midrange decks. Good stats, solid keywords, and card draw in one unit. While Vara, Vengeance-Seeker would be the other auto-include in this slot, the inclusion of Champion of Cunning means she sits this one out. The other options weren't too exciting, so I added a bit more removal to the list.\n\nOther Choices: Impending Doom, Midnight Gale, Torgov, Icecap Trader, Vara, Vengeance-Seeker\n\n5-Drops\nChampion of Cunning: Probably the first unit most players think of with regard to the Feln faction. I tend to favor the Aegis ability first, because the AI will definitely throw removal at it, but if the pump ability is active, I'll play the unit out.\n\nOther Choices: Jotun Feast-Caller\n\n6-Drops\nBlack-Sky Harbinger: Champion/Harbinger have been closing out Feln Midrange decks since the very beginning. While Harbinger lacks the stats usually associated with a top-end unit, the evasion, life gain, and board impact make it an easy choice.\n\nOther Choices: Thunderstrike Dragon\n\nCard Draw\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nOther Choices: Cull the Deck, Dark Return, Devour, Wisdom of the Elders\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: Most of my Midrange builds do not run 1-Drops because, for the most part, they are underwhelming. That leaves Seek Power as the best solution for Fixing, as it can give the deck something to do turn 1.\n\nOther Choices: Petition, Vara's Favor\n\nMarket\nKerendon Merchant: Primal offers no Relic removal options for the Market, so Kerendon Merchant is the pick here. Neither Merchant is very exciting as a unit, however.\n\nOther Choices: Jennev Merchant\n\nMiscellaneous\nDizo's Office: Unit removal, card draw, life gain, and a solid Agenda payoff makes the Office a decent pick here. I don't usually go out of my way to protect the site, however.\n\nOther Choices: Madness, Mirror Image\n\nUnit Removal\nDesecrate: This card has \"Feln\" written all over it. It pairs especially well with Stormtamer Operative, as the damage it deals to you is reduced by the Operative's ability.\n\nPermafrost: While decent as an early-game control option, I tend to use Permafrost as a way to remove blockers from combat. They're also pretty effective against annoying Revenge units like Inquisitor Makto and Elias, the Broken Wing.\n\nOther Choices: Annihilate, Crystallize, Deathstrike, Feeding Time, Rindra's Choice\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 33 (25 power, 4 Rhysta, Acantha's Herald, and 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 26 sources of Primal and 23 sources of Shadow (counting Diplomatic Seal and Seek Power as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

Helps you draw Justice Sigils, so no mana block and extra targets for market.\n\nFollowing cards are discard cards.\n\n1. Herald's Song\n2. Master Cartographer\n3. Workshop Tinker\n\n\n**Renown Mechanic**\n\nFollowing Cards that are renown,\n\n1. Hojan, Crownbreaker\n2. Aniyah, Arctic Sheriff\n\nHojan goes really well with this deck. Lifesteal, push potential with extra sigil power boost. However, Hojan is also used as a removal eater. Taking elimination cards in the beginning phase for the team. Aniyah acts as mid range annoyance for your opponent. Rarely this deck will carry out victory in early phase of the game. Often you will find yourself either losing or winning by the end of mid-game. Plus she gets really reliable once she gets aegis, buying your little bit more time and making your opponent use 2 cards against your 1 card. (Pledge actually saved my opening hands few times.)\n\n\n**Weapon Cards**\n\n1. Vanquisher's Blade\n\nFor renowns and removal(plus voidbound). Since this deck runs Privilege of Rank, many times you'll find yourself having 5 mana by turn 5. It's pretty easy to pull off vanquish when you need to.\n\n\n**Aggro + Swarm Stoppers**\n\n1. Copperhall Bailiff (Also AoE Aegis Popper)\n2. Harsh Rule (3 copies)\n3. End of the Story (1 copy in market)\n\nThis deck don't use Primal AoE damage cards such as Hailstorm. Instead, it banks on heavy removal with low mana cost minions till mid-mid late game.\n\n**Late Game**\n\n1. Svetya, Orene of Kosul (After mana 8, draw Minions, preferably after your deck gets shined by Svetya, Merciful Orene. (Plus, buys you a turn from your opponent with spells)\n2. Svetya, Merciful Orene (Buffs your deck + Aegis Beat Stick)\n3. Telut, Queen's Hand (Plays well with renowns, and reliable if you have at least a single minion card on the field before summon)\n4. Korovyat Palace (Just 2 copies. Any more than that felt like a dead hand since it has no removal. In my opinion, with \"6-costs draw-2\" doesn't justify having more than 2 copies in your deck.)\n\nYou only really need one Svetya, Merciful Orene in your market. Her cost isn't so good like other scion cards. So often she becomes a dead hand until later phase. Better to have her in the market, and bring it out right before you are ready.\n\n\n**Market**\n\n1. Vision of Austerity (Since no Bore, I used this.)\n2. Honor of Claws (Surprisingly I felt good having this in the market. Not just because it has target for Privilege of Rank, but giving you opportunity to cope with bad hand.\n\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nStill Work in Progress. But wanted to share. Tell me how it goes.\n\nThanks."

        "success": "A different take on an Ixtun Palace deck, this time inspired somewhat by Manu's Winchest Zuberi list from the World Championships last year. Zuberi dying for no value to something like Slay is legitimately problematic, but fortunately this list has 16 cheap pieces (8 smugglers, 4 strategize, and 4 wisdom) to instantly gain value from him if that's something you're worried about in slower matchups. Whirling Duo gains life and wears a Withstand well, and the rest of the deck is fairly standard fire and primal smuggler draw and removal stuff. The market is the bit I'm most uncertain about atm. I think Deepforged Plate is a firm inclusion because pulling it with Red Canyon Smuggler puts a very firm clock on an opponent in a topdecking situation. Howling Peak is probably the best late-game powerhouse here, even if it rubs up against the maindeck Palaces, purely because Martyr's Chains costing JJJJ is fairly difficult for this deck to achieve off of only 12 justice sources. Bore is great. Skycrag Banner might be unnecessary, and Jawbone Greatsword could be a Burn Them All. I wish this deck had soemthing comparable to Statuary Maiden, something that all 8 smugglers could pull on turn 3 to play on turn 4 and force an aggressive opponent to have removal or be stonewalled. Unfortunately, I don't think these colours have access to anything of that nature and power level just yet.\n\nEdit: It occurs to me that if you cut Wisdom of the Elders for Privilege of Rank, probably then finding room for Bulletshaper, then you could possibly justify Martyr's Chains in the market. An idea to explore."

        "success": "So this is basically a \"Time\" take on FJS - replacing our FJS Gauntlet deck: https://eternalwarcry.com/decks/details/MMUIN2HFG1w/fjs-gauntlet-march-2019\n\nWe lose Xo, Bore, Torch, Maiden, etc. We replace some of the Smugglers and Displays accordingly, and we gain Sand Storm Titan and the Xenan Temple - which is pretty good - as well as Finest Hour (replacing Torch).\n\nSo, how does it do compared to FJS? Well, we still have our Saviors that remain all stars - and in fact are slightly better in the TJS shell. Why? Because of finest hour. Our 1/1's turn still eat premium removal and kill the x/1's like Oni Ronin - but now they get a combat trick to eat AI creatures. It's not a HUGE deal, but it is something.\n\nThe deck plays similarly to FJS in that we still have all of the Defiances, slays, vanquish, etc. However, our influence requirements are slightly more taxing since we now have 8 Four Drops in Little Vara and Sand Storm Titan to go with our 3 Drop Bailiffs - so that's TT JJ and SS. Accordingly, I have gone with Petition over Seek Power. I do not know if that is correct, but it seems good?\n\nI was very uneasy about the Ebon Smuggler. That 2/2 body for 3 without the double damage upside worried me, and I actually tried the Auralian Merchant in its place at first. But Auralian just limited our Market too much, and grabbing Harsh Rule was already hard enough with only having 4 Justice Merchants versus 8 in FJS. So I wanted something that could grab all three Sites in the Market and ended up with Ebon. It took me a while to get used to figuring out when to run out Ebon, but it's actually really nice to have an ambush creature as another way to surprise the AI.\n\nI chose Varas Choice to replace Maiden - after experimenting with a myriad of options. Since we no longer have Bore, our 4 Displays take care of that issue - and all three options for the Display are actually quite good versus the AI decks - combat tricks, board wipes, fixing, ramp and sometimes just digging with Scout Crests trying to find an answer. Oh, and the Displays are nice fast speed buffs for lethal when attacking with Regent's Tomb.\n\nWe actually end up casting the Saviors in this deck more often than in FJS, and the sites are an integral part of the overall game plan. Overall, I \"think\" the deck is slower than FJS just because we seem to have more options than FJS. FJS sometimes provides very specific lines that are the only ones we can reasonably choose, whereas this deck gives you aggressive vs safe choices - neither of which is necessarily wrong, but the safe choice allows us to increase our win percentage at the expense of playing out a little slower.\n\nHaving said that, I want to be clear that losing Xo definitely hurts some of the consistency, but having 8 high end 4 Drops that highly impact the board can result in some very fast games. So is this deck better? I am on the fence here, and would love to hear some feedback and thoughts about many of the deck choices such as thoughts on:\n\n1) Petition versus Seek Power\n2) Vara's Choice versus ???\n3) Xenan Temple/Dizo versus Passage of Eons or ???\n4) Merchants? Anyone like some of the mono colored ones better??\n\nI think the win percentage is relatively the same as FJS - and this deck might be slightly better against the Bosses, not sure about that. Regardless, I actually enjoy this deck more than FJS right now as I have gotten a little burned out with that deck and this one seems to have a little more \"play\" with it.\n\nHope you enjoy it!!"

My choice of capitalization? A big stick in the form of Staff of the Arch-Magister, which is regularly a 20/20 weapon for 5. Naturally, I tried to put other win conditions in here too through Rizahn, Xo, Howling Peak, and Plate.\n\nThis is not a tier 1 deck by any means, but it does win games and I have fun while playing it. It's especially fun to start a chain of 0 cost draw cards and then have your opponent concede just because.\n\nI also made a variation with shadow instead of justice using Vara. Both are fun, this is just the decklist I decided to post (though happy to post the other if anyone wants. Tamarys is fun and the longer the game is out, the better she gets."

        "success": "This is an aggro focused Ixtun deck using some of the best cards in the game with Xo and Hojan, while trying to incorporate the new cards I think are strong. This build has been performing very solid in Master rank. Play aggressive and keep pressure on the opponent, this deck has a lot of firepower.\n\nI'm really liking Korovyat Palace. The Withstand unit buff is usually my number one choice, as it can trigger your Hojan Renown (and also if you want to run Aniyah) or it can turn Rizahn and Red Canyon Smuggler into a lot of face damage. Wisdom of the Elders gives you needed draw, and Sack the City is another win condition with just a couple big units out. The icing on the cake is the static Endurance that all your 4+ attack units get (including Rizahn, despite his Reckless). After the site goes off you can use Svetya to dig for even more units with her Pay 8 ability. Palace in this build has been a much stronger main deck card over Howling Peak.\n\nI'm also running Svetya because she feels like an insane card right now, she wards off removal/locks your opponent out of spells while you continue to drop minions and push damage. I was running 3x Aniyah in this deck, but swapped her out for Jotun Hurler, which feels way more natural here (though Aniyah also works fine), with the added card advantage and extra Snowball spells to combo with Howling Peak Smuggler. Display of Honor has been huge in this deck, it can fish your Plate/Blade weapons back, give you unit damage, or a much needed polymorph effect. I'm also running a Howling Peak in the market, which has been pretty clutch certain games (copying a giant Aegis unit etc.), or especially when you don't draw Palace for turn 6."

        "success": "Why each card is in the deck.\n\nPower Base-\n\nIt\u2019s very simple but has been pretty balanced so far, maybe needs a bit of tinkering but not bad for a 5F deck.\n\nUnits-\n\nSmugglers, Xo, Brel. Efficient units that have great value. Smugglers are great early game units that get the best market options for your situation. Xo is an incredibly powerful unit that works as good Market fodder and can be bought out later. Brel was chosen mostly since she fits well with both Display of Ambition AND Display of Honor which I\u2019ll address later.\n\nDisplays-\n\nDisplay of Ambition- Solid removal and every unit in the deck is a fantastic buyback target. The Overwhelm mode is pretty irrelevant.\n\nDisplay of Honor- Weakest Display by far and is probably better off as a Hailstorm or Wispm of the Elders but I like the Display suite theme. Transforming units can be important in matchups with Display of Ambition and Reanimator. Lifesteal and a surprise pump is great but we have limited units so it\u2019s typically not an option. Being able to buyback Brel\u2019s Mallet comes up occasionally and it\u2019s a sweet synergy.\n\nDisplay of Instinct- Probably our best Display overall. Great removal that also deals with Sites, able to counter key spells in matchups such as reanimator and FJS, can occasionally bounce units which is pretty good since it either resets Xo or a Merchant or we can replay Brel and get another Mallet OR the dream of pumping an existing Mallet.\n\nDisplay of Knowledge- Likely our second best Display. QuickDraw clause is mostly irrelevant, we run a package of Relics that can synergize with our game plan or pull ahead and we want to make sure we know which relic we want in each matchup. Gavel for Void abusing decks, Crown is mostly for fun but has been solid against Temporal and other Control decks, Daisho is great against control decks that can\u2019t deal with relics and can just eat multiple units if needed, Knuckelbones is a win condition, as is Martyr\u2019s Chains, and Temporal is great when the board is clear so we can be full control. The unit tucking ability is excellent for making it through the early game by removing units.\n\nDisplay of Vision- mostly here for Ramp and fixing but also extremely important against token style decks and being able to remove cards like opposing Chains/Eternity Core/Temporal/Crown is fantastic\n\nOther Spells-\n\nHarsh Rule-Sweeper to help stabilize\n\nSeek Power-Fixing\n\nMarket-Every card can be found by either Smuggler\n\nSlay-Unconditional removal\nRegent\u2019s Tomb-Fantastic card to follow a Smuggler. Disrupts opponent, helps hit power, possible win condition.\nMemento Mori-Ramp and fixing for our crazy deck\nShatterglass Mage-A body that also removes attachments\nMoment of Creation- An excellent win condition that is frequently 8+. This card has really overperformed\n\nAny questions? Leave a comment for me below =) Hope you enjoy"

I've made a ton of modifications to this deck overtime as I climbed ladder, so many of the cards here are ones that have treated me very well. I'm aware there may be versions of cards that work better than some of the others I have, but I've yet to see or consider them."

Probably merchants.\n\nQuick tips:\nIf you have the choice always pledge Cykalis cause you might need the extra 4 dmg you get from him.\nIf you draw Invoke get startegize from the market to put it away"

This lets you more easily neutralize enemy threats while snowballing by yourself.\n\nI chose Xo of the Endless Hoard as my hero since, simply put, this is arguably one of the best cards in the game at this time so you want him in your hand early and often. Giving him aegis or unblockable on top of his already-copious bonuses is also wonderful.\n\nThis list has taken me to 6-3 and 7-2 finishes in its current form. I'm not sure I'll have time to play my last 5 leaderboard runs this event. A better pilot would likely have more success with it.\n\nIf I do change anything, it will be to add further power tutors (such as Kaleb's Favor) but I think the deck is already pretty compelling as-is."

Even means that you should ramp with even cost spells.\nTo fully show power efficiency this deck uses mostly even cost with small exceptions.\n\nDeck Design\n- 28 Units, 16 win cons 12 with Pledge\n- 8 Ramp relics\n- 12 Spells, 4 utility, 4 Ramp, 6 Draw\n- 25 Sigils\n\nGame Plan\nYou absolutely need a pledge card in starting hand, so you redraw until you have one. It doesn't mean that you will have no chance winning if you will have none, but Glasshopper will be less effective.\nAlso as a second part of play you need at least 1 card with ramp for 2 power. Crucial part is influence management, you need 3 Primal for Daraka, Queensguard and Eilyn, the Rising Storm, also you need 3 Time influence for Apex Predator.\n\nSynergies\n- Glasshopper: reason why you play this deck. It cycles itself into big threats and reduce their cost at same time. It is arguable best card in deck.\nMoonstone Vanguard, Eilyn, the Rising Storm, Apex Predator, Tunneling Gargantua our cards that work with hopper.\n- Daraka, Queensguard + Eilyn, the Rising Storm: Daraka is very underplayed card, good stats and control potential, also has a neat synergy with all Eilyn units, making them hard to counter.\n\nCards & Reasoning\n- Messenger Hawk: more copies for our cards.\n- Seek Power: another t1 play that helps in stabilization, searches for us such needed Sigils.\n- Glasshopper, Trail Maker, Power Stone: t2 ramps with different tasks. Glasshopper gets our pledged threats, Trail Maker leads us to desired influence levels, Power Stone is a simple ramp that doesn't fear unit removal.\n- Honor of Claws: Good draw effect.\n- Call for Aid, Eternity Core: our t3 ramp. Call for Aid is a fast ramp with cycle and gain life effect and Eternity Core is a great ramp that doesn't afraid of unit removal.\n- Moonstone Vanguard, Eilyn, the Rising Storm, Apex Predator: pledge finishers with great benefit from Glasshopper synergy. Eilyn and Apex can be used as a unit removal in different ways. Moonstone is a card generation mechanism and guardian of life total.\n- Daraka, Queensguard: removal & protection for Eilyn on a big body that is hard to block.\n- Eilyn, the Rising Storm, Tunneling Gargantua, Apex Predator our fatties. Also you can consider all of those as a removal coz they will kill in most cases opponent's units.\n\nIf you pleased with a deck then don't forget to hit that like button.\nIf you have questions about deck you can ask it in comment section"

All comments are appreciated."

Rallying Banner is also an absurdly powerful, almost always first pick (almost being if there is some absolutely ridiculous rare in the pack) card that can win games on its own.\n\nKey to this format = take the best card out of any given pack, period, and then just figure out the mana after the fact.

        "success": "This is my version of Elysian Chalice Control for Gauntlet play. Lets take a look at the cards:\n\nDeck Strategy\nA very typical Chalice deck. Try to survive the early game until you can get a Chalice into play, and then slowly outvalue your opponent. Most of the units offer additional value beyond meeting the requirements for Chalice, and it is possible to win a game without finding a Chalice (especially with a Crow in play).\n\nWin Condition\nCrystalline Chalice: The backbone of the deck. The drawback of its ability (exhausting a unit) can be negated with Infinite Hourglass. Getting multiples into play usually snowballs into a rather quick (well\u2026quick for the deck) win.\n\nUnits\nAcquisitive Crow: There are a lot of really useful 1-cost spells, which makes Crow a second win condition in the deck. I don't usually have a problem finding a Chalice, but there have been games where Chalice hasn't been necessary because the AI didn't have an answer to Crow. A tremendous value generator in this deck.\n\nAmaran Camel: The stabilizer. Gain health off of a few draws and the AI will start prioritizing the Camels with its removal, leaving your other units to flex their muscles. The deck wouldn't be as consistent without them.\n\nAmaran Stinger: The scorpions certainly don't need to be buffed to be effective, but they do provide extra targets for Chalice. Worst case scenario, she is a pretty decent early game blocker thanks to 4 health.\n\nBazaar Trickster: A great card in a deck that usually ends up with a great deal of power. I try not to play it until I can activate it at least once, but that isn't always possible. The fact that the ability can be triggered even if the Trickster is exhausted is key to its value here.\n\nCampfire Watchman: An absurd early game ground blocker that can be buffed with Chalice to a 4 / 10 stat line. I feel like it was made for Chalice decks.\n\nEphemeral Wisp: Another early game ground blocker that can absorb a lot of damage.\n\nPteriax Hatchling: The extra copies can be used as Market fodder, or they can be used to exploit the AI's disdain for anything with Flying.\n\nScorpion Wasp: Not really a Chalice target, but I have buffed one before. Wasp is really the only answer the deck has to really big threats. The bane of Sandstorm Titans everywhere.\n\nOther Choices: Archive Curator, Breeze Dancer, Derry Cathain, Ripclaw Rider, Dusk Raider, Illumination Wisp, Lumen Defender, Sand Viper, Snowcrust Yeti, Stormtamer Operative, Veteran Strategist, Waystone Infuser\n\nCard Draw\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nOther Choices: Call for Aid, Moondial, Temple Scribe, Wisdom of the Elders\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: There aren't a lot of tricky influence requirements in the deck - just double Primal for Chalice and Crow - so I went with the cheapest option.\n\nOther Choices: Amber Acolyte, Find the Way, Petition\n\nMarket\nAuralian Merchant: Another good early blocker. The ramp isn't as important as the 4 health or the ability to grab a Chalice, but it can help.\n\nOther Choices: Jennev Merchant\n\nUnit Removal\nPermafrost: Usually, once the deck gets rolling, removal isn't necessary, so I went with the best early game option. A great answer to annoying early game Oni and Yeti.\n\nOther Choices: Equivocate, Passage of Eons\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 33 (25 power, 4 Auralian Merchant, and 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 22 sources of Time and 23 sources of Primal (counting Diplomatic Seal and Seek Power as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

Life is easy when you open two bombs of the same color (though they were in the third and fourth pack, respectively). A lot of people don't like them, but the Viper's Bites were really good and in this deck with multiple Renown triggers, a 1/5 Flying, double Fireheart Recruit and several large dudes they simply made a lot of sense.\n\nNoteworthy cards in my sideboard-\n\n1 Scorpion (the last cut- I really wanted to play it)\n2 Awaken the Ages (tempting to ramp into one of my good 5 drops but I just couldn't find room and I hate that it's a RANDOM Sigil)\n1 Sirocco Elementalist (meh... I think this card is playable but almost always underwhelming. It only makes my bad decks as an in general)\n1 Copperhall Porter (I have many better 2 drops and in this case the ability hardly matters. Yes, a Sigil is a Sigil, but Green is my lightest color as it is and I don't ever need double Green so essentially I'm just playing a bad creature, that I can't always even play on turn 2 mind you, that digs up an essentially colorless Sigil when it dies)\n1 Siraf's Beacon (I don't see myself as a really fast beatdown deck which is what this card wants and I wanted to play as few Green cards as possible to make my mana base more consistent since I don't have as much fixing as I'd like and I have very powerful cards in White that I need to be able to play reliably when I draw them)\n1 Sky Crew (I don't see myself having trouble finishing games- I think my late game is super strong as is- and again I wanted to play as few Green cards as realistically possible for the sake of my mana base)\n1 Skycrag Huntsman (The argument can be made that this should have been played over Lazy Firemane. Most of the time if I survive til late game I probably win. I opted for a more aggressive approach and I felt I had solid early game defense already, but I don't hate this swap)\n1 Astromancer's Compass (I think this card is pretty underwhelming in general outside of very specific decks. I felt my card quality was high enough to where I didn't need to play this or really have room for it)\n\nThe commentary is mostly for myself and my own \"putting my thoughts on paper\" kind of thing, but if any of this helps anyone else, awesome! :)"

        "success": "I tend to build my Midrange Gauntlet decks using a very linear shell: 8 1- or 2-Drops, 8 3-Drops, 8 4-Drops, 4 5-Drops, 4 6-Drops, and 4 each of Card Draw, Fixing, Market and Unit Removal, with the remainder of the deck filled with whatever I think the deck can use. With that in mind, I thought I would go over the card choices here:\n\n2-Drops\nDusk Raider and Stormtamer Operative: There are quite a few big Overwhelm units in the deck, and Dusk Raider can make them pretty difficult to block effectively. Stormtamer Operative is one of those cards that takes advantage of a blind spot with the AI: It doesn't take it's ability into account before using removal. It will continually try and Torch 3-health units. It will continually try to ping 1-health units with Temper and Vara's Favor. It's ridiculous the amount of work Operative does just by sitting on the board. That being said, drawing it late isn't great, so there are only 3 copies in the deck.\n\nOther Choices: Resolute Monk\n\n3-Drops\nDawnwalker and False Prince: If you can cast Xenan Initiation on Dawnwalker, it turns into a value engine. With 4 Time influence in play, every other non-2-drop, non-Merchant unit has at least 5 power, so it's pretty easy to boomerang in and out of the void. False Prince is another blind spot for the AI: It will not target it with removal unless the removal does 5 or more damage. Sometimes the AI will get lucky with a Torch only because the initial plan was to use 2 Torches, but it still ends up Torching a frog, so it's a win in my book (The best is when the AI silences the Prince!).\n\nOther Choices: Amaran Stinger, Lunar Magus, Skycrag Scalebreaker, Teacher of Humility\n\n4-Drops\nChampion of Wisdom and Sandstorm Titan: With Titan in the deck, there isn't any pressure to get 4 Primal influence into play for the Champion, and since Dawnwalker needs 4 Time influence anyway, it's a pretty solid option here. It is the weakest of the big units, though, so there are only 3 copies in the deck. Titan is generally an auto-include in any Time-based Midrange deck, and is simply the best option in this slot.\n\nOther Choices: Torgov, Icecap Trader\n\n5-Drops\nCirso, the Great Glutton: Yet another great target for Xenan Initiation, and a pretty good target for a Dusk Raider buff. I don't need much of an excuse to include Cirso in an Elysian build.\n\nOther Choices: Jotun Feast-Caller, Moonstone Vanguard\n\n6-Drops\nWorldbearer Behemoth: The top end choices were rather underwhelming, so I doubled up in the 5-drop slot. Another big Overwhelm unit to use with Dusk Raider and Xenan Initiation. It also helps thin the deck out while ramping up to 8 power for Xenan Obelisk. It is also a pretty good target for Alhed, Mount Breaker's ability.\n\nOther Choices: Curiox, the Collector, Eilyn, the Rising Storm, Thunderstrike Dragon\n\nCard Draw\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nOther Choices: Ancient Lore, Call for Aid, Temple Scribe, Vital Arcana, Wisdom of the Elders\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: Most of my Midrange builds do not run 1-Drops because, for the most part, they are underwhelming. That leaves Seek Power as the best solution for Fixing, as it can give the deck something to do turn 1.\n\nOther Choices: Amber Acolyte, Find the Way, Petition, Secret Pages, Trail Maker\n\nMarket\nAuralian Merchant and Great Valley Smuggler: Auralian Merchant brings ramp to the table, which gets the deck to the mid-game units faster. Great Valley Smuggler is a solid stat line that can get extra value from Obelisk. The deck doesn't really need 8 merchants, though, so cutting one or the other for something else wouldn't impact it too much. I just didn't see anything I liked better for the slot.\n\nOther Choices: Crown of Possibilities, Infinite Hourglass, Jennev Merchant, Mirror Image, Pit of Lenekta\n\nUnit Removal\nXenan Initiation: Combines really well with the big Overwhelm units in the deck (well, except for False Prince). Dawnwalker is the top choice, but I don't usually hold it to wait for the \"perfect\" unit.\n\nOther Choices: Equivocate, Permafrost, Striking Snake Formation\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 33 (25 power, 4 Auralian Merchant, 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 25 sources of Time and 20 sources of Primal (counting Diplomatic Seal and Seek Power as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

It actually runs well in gauntlet and moderately well in casual. I've considered running a market to draw Howling Peak more reliably, but it's far from the only win condition and overall it generally plays on curve nicely.\n\nAs always let me know what you think. All comments are appreciated."

        "success": "This deck is based off of an Elysian Killers deck I saw on a Twitch Tournament stream. I honestly can not remember who was piloting it, nor the tournament, and I've searched high and low here for the deck with no luck. Regardless, I found it to be a pretty fun deck to play, and a nice alternative to the much more common Xenan Killers archetype. Let's take a look at the cards:\n\nDeck Strategy\nUse Hailstorm and Permafrost along with the Smuggler to stall the board early until you can start dropping the heavy mid-game units, all of which provide extra value beyond their stat lines. Use Savagery and Xenan Initiation to pick off blockers until your units have a clear path to victory.\n\nWin Conditions\nCirso, the Great Glutton: No Elysian Killers deck is complete without Cirso. The only unit in this deck that laughs at Deadly units. Also the only unit that comes with Overwhelm (because he's better, duh). Still waiting for my Cirso avatar!\n\nJotun Feast-Caller: A hard-to-kill unit that draws a card or two whenever Killer is activated? OK, if I have to\u2026\n\nMoonstone Vanguard: Pairs with Sandstorm Titan to get around Stun-heavy decks, and pairs with Jotun Feast-Caller to provide you with plenty of options.\n\nSandstorm Titan: A natural for Killer decks, thanks to Endurance. Keeps fliers in check. Giant stat stick for its cost. Seems like a perfect fit for the deck!\n\nCard Draw\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nWisdom of the Elders: With all of the units costing 4 or 5 power, it's best to keep the utility cards as low in cost as possible, which is why no Honor of Claws here.\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: Plenty of options for this slot, but I didn't see a need to run anything else.\n\nMarket\nGreat Valley Smuggler: The deck doesn't need the ramp, so I went with the best stat line available.\n\nOther Choices: Auralian Merchant, Jennev Merchant\n\nUnit Removal\nHailstorm: Gets rid of the vast majority of Grenadin, Onis, Humbugs, and other annoying early game pests. With an Infinite Hourglass in play, all of the units in the deck will survive the blast.\n\nPermafrost: Buys the time needed to get to the big units. They don't really need to stick around the whole match to be effective.\n\nSavagery: I have really liked this card. Removing a unit, drawing a card (or cards) and pushing face damage puts you so far ahead. One of my favorite cards from Set 5 (Defiance).\n\nXenan Initiation: You could make an argument for Twilight Hunt because it's cheaper, but I like Initiation better in most cases.\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 31 (27 power and 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 23 sources of each color (counting Diplomatic Seal and Seek Power as a source for each).\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

The deck is really designed to maximize the the power of Tavrod, and put you in a position where one attack should close out the game even if he dies in combat. I'm still not in love with the market and the curve is a bit wonky, so let me know if you have any ideas or how if goes for you if you try it out.\n\nEdit: the Seek Power made the deck feel a bit heavy on power so I'm trying Copperhall Porter and Vara's Favor instead. Should keep us from getting starved, but actually do things in games where we're flooded"

You take all the cards which have ever seen play in AP Mid, jam them together, season to your preference, and choose Tavrod as your hero. You can instead swap him for Telut, if that's more your style. The deck plays mostly the same either way: play dudes, suit 'em up, see if your opponent has an answer. Eventually you play your hero, maybe. Tavrod is the better hero choice if you seem to be running into a lot of FJS; Telut is better against board stalls.\n\nThis is by no means an \"optimal\" list, since just like AP Mid in ranked there is a lot of room to adjust it to your preferences. Feel free to swap in things like Protect/Corrupt, more minotaurs, or replace all the legendaries with other things you have lying around. Pump spells would be fine, as would inspire units or more ways to pop face aegis."

        "success": "This deck is a fairly linear attempt at a Combrei Control deck. Lets take a look at the cards:\n\nDeck Strategy\nThe main avenue for victory with this deck is a giant Mystic Ascendant that has Overwhelm thanks to Porcelain Mask. There are a couple other options to help get over the finish line (Sword of the Sky King, Pit of Lenekta), but the main victory line involves controlling the board, ramping into Ascendant, drawing a bunch of options, and denying the AI the ability to chump block.\n\nWin Conditions\nMarshal Ironthorn: Ironthorn is a natural to pair with Ascendant. Extra cards, extra stats, extra power - I'm not up on the lore, but I hope the Combrei faction is as greedy in the story as their cards seem to indicate. In the event that Ascendant doesn't show up, clearing the board with Ironthorn's Ultimate can also end the game.\n\nMystic Ascendant: The main Win Condition of the deck. Ordinarily a somewhat lackluster board option, Set 5 (Defiance) gave Time Porcelain Mask, and the one Time card that gets A LOT better with Overwhelm is this guy. If you have the pieces already, you only really need one of these on the board (so you don't draw all of your deck).\n\nSword of the Sky King: A back-up Win Condition for the deck. It's actually \"Plan C\" (I would go with Pit over Sword if given a choice), so it's more like a back-up for the back-up, but it's still a solid option here. Relic Weapons in Gauntlet tend to force the AI to make REALLY poor attacks just to remove the weapon. It's also good at picking off annoying creatures like Blistersting Wasp and Steward of the Past.\n\nOther Choices: Knight-Chancellor Siraf, The Great Parliament\n\nCard Draw\nCall for Aid: Combrei doesn't have the greatest options when it comes to Card Draw, so a value card like Call that also heals and ramps is pretty good.\n\nTemple Scribe: Another value option, this time offering life gain and a chump blocker. It is odd that, in a faction devoted to learning and knowledge, this is the best Card Draw option. But I suppose the slower Card Draw in Time does make a bit of sense, flavor-wise.\n\nOther Choices: Ancient Lore, Inspire, Moonstone Vanguard, Vital Arcana\n\nFixing\nFind the Way: More food for the Ascendants. If the extra copy created by Echo isn't needed, it becomes the perfect option to Market away.\n\nSeek Power: No need to overthink anything here.\n\nOther Choices: Amber Acolyte, Petition, Privilege of Rank, Secret Pages, Trail Maker\n\nMarket\nAuralian Merchant: The best option here, not because of Market choices, but because of the ramp. The fact that Justice doesn't have any answer to Relics also makes me lean towards the Time Merchant here.\n\nOther Choices: Winchest Merchant\n\nMiscellaneous\nWorldbearer Behemoth: Feed. The. Machine. Getting a Behemoth rolling and then dropping an Ascendant is usually the quickest path to victory. It doesn't have to stay in play either - 2 or 3 power pulled out of the deck with Behemoth is generally game over.\n\nOther Choices: Citywide Ban, Etched Monolith, Eternity Core, Infinite Hourglass, Sandstorm Scarf\n\nUnit Removal\nDefiance: The best removal choice available for the early game. Not so great against Warcry units, but Vanquish can clean up the buffed units.\n\nHarsh Rule: Eternal's easy button. Push it when you need it.\n\nPorcelain Mask: While played for its static ability, the Silence effect is a nice little bonus. It can clean up some really annoying units (like anything with Deadly or something like Hero of the People) and it can give you a little information about the AI's hand.\n\nVanquish: The standard Justice removal option. For those times where you need to get rid of a big threat, but don't want to push the easy button.\n\nOther Choices: Auric Runehammer, Desert Marshal, Martyr's Chains, Striking Snake Formation, Valkyrie Enforcer, Xenan Initiation\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 45 (25 power, 4 Auralian Merchant, 4 Call for Aid, 4 Find the Way, and 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 31 Time sources and 26 Justice sources (counting Find the Way as 2 sources of each, and Seek Power as a source for each).\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

The end-goal is to market for Governor Sahin and cheat out Martyr's Chains, which is a guaranteed hit since there are no actual relics in the main.\n\nStrategize can be used to tuck copies of Chains that get stuck in hand. Alternatively, the deck functions as a regular time midrange deck, and has no problem simply winning with strong units like Sandstorm Titan and Moonstone Vanguard.\n\nMoondial is the market relic of choice, considering Severin reduces the activation, and lets you grind when you need to. Overall, this deck is pretty experimental, and I'm sure there are saner ways of utilizing the new Severin. Still, this deck will be on my testing list once Homecoming releases.\n\nEdit: I've updated the list after some initial testing. It works rather well, and the addition of Amaran Stinger has been particularly strong."

        "success": "I tend to build my Midrange Gauntlet decks using a very linear shell: 8 1- or 2-Drops, 8 3-Drops, 8 4-Drops, 4 5-Drops, 4 6-Drops, and 4 each of Card Draw, Fixing, Market and Unit Removal, with the remainder of the deck filled with whatever I think the deck can use. With that in mind, I thought I would go over the card choices here:\n\n2-Drops\nAwakened Student and Resolute Monk: It's hard to beat Student when it comes to 2-Drops. If not answered early, it can get pretty big, and it's a very nice target for Sword of Unity. Monk can push some nice early damage heading into Combrei's fairly stout mid-game units.\n\nOther Choices: Hojan, Crownbreaker\n\n3-Drops\nAuric Record Keeper and Knight-Chancellor Siraf: Record Keeper is a nice stat stick that can permanently buff another unit if removed. Siraf is a good early game unit, a good target for Killer or Sword of Unity, and can win games late thanks to her ability.\n\nOther Choices: Amaran Stinger, Lunar Magus, Teacher of Humility, Valkyrie Enforcer\n\n4-Drops\nSandstorm Titan and Sheriff Marley: Titan is a no-brainer in a deck with no flying units. Take care with Titan against the heavy Flier decks - the AI will remove or silence it at first chance. Titan's immunity to Stun makes the Stun-heavy AI decks a lot easier (although be careful of Rebuke). Marley is a solid pick that can create chump blockers every turn while potentially having a Silence at her disposal.\n\nOther Choices: Copperhall Elite\n\n5-Drops\nMoonstone Vanguard: Possibly the best non-Smuggler Rare in Defiance (flip a coin between Vanguard and Hojan, Crownbreaker - both can be gross, in different ways). The AI will often attack into Vanguard thinking it has lethal, which can gain you enough life to not only stabilize, but go on the offensive. Another unit that can abuse the Stun-heavy AI deck strategy.\n\nOther Choices: Amilli, Cloudmarshal, Marshal Ironthorn, Serene Meditant, Worldbearer Behemoth\n\n6-Drops\nTelut, Queen's Hand: A no-brainer, really. It makes Student and Monk bigger. It provides more power to use Siraf's ability. It clears the board with Chains in play. It fills your board with Pit in play. Also, despite Combrei's \"Big Bodies\" reputation, the units that cost 6+ power are kind of underwhelming.\n\nOther Choices: Nothing too exciting. Maybe Svetya, Merciful Orene or Vodakhan, Temple Speaker, but neither feels better than Telut.\n\nCard Draw\nSeek Power: Combrei doesn't have great low-cost card draw, so I went with extra Fixing here to synergize with the Empower units in the deck.\n\nOther Choices: Ancient Lore, Call for Aid, Inspire, Temple Scribe\n\nFixing\nSecret Pages: When used in conjunction with Student or Monk, Secret Pages becomes a sort of combat trick. It also works rather well with Pit or Chains in play. It can also help to get from 5 to 7 for Telut.\n\nOther Choices: Find the Way, Petition, Trail Maker\n\nMarket\nAuralian Merchant: No smuggler means choosing between a Merchant with a useful ability or one that doesn't really do anything. Justice also has no way to deal with Relics for the Market.\n\nOther Choices: Winchest Merchant\n\nMiscellaneous\nMartyr's Chains: When Chains was first revealed, it feels like everyone focused on the removal portion and figured it was a Control card (including me). Its strength, though, is definitely the buff ability. The cost keeps it from being a top-end finisher for Midrange decks (which is why Korovyat Palace is so good), but including a couple of copies in a deck that wants to play power seems OK. It does a really good job of clearing up board stalls, which tend to happen with Combrei decks in the Gauntlet.\n\nOther Choices: Inquisitor's Blade, Stand Together\n\nUnit Removal\nXenan Initiation: A great removal option in Combrei due to the beefy units, but really good in any deck running Moonstone Guardian (or Sword of Unity, for that matter). Just remember that Killer does not trigger Telut's ability.\n\nOther Choices: Auric Runehammer, Defiance, Desert Marshal, Scorpion Wasp, Stormhalt Knife, Vanquish, Vanquisher's Blade\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 37 (25 power, 4 Auralian Merchant, 4 Secret Pages, 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 26 sources of each color (counting Secret Pages and Seek Power as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

Stunning and equivocate hurt our strategy.\nWinchest, Combrei Chains are favorable.\nAggro can be a problem but recognizing it and pinging with intervention and favor, then pushing a beastcaller through or getting a Vara to stick on turn 4, help stabilize."

        "success": "This is my version of TJP Temporal Control for Gauntlet play. Lets take a look at the cards:\n\nDeck Strategy\nFind a Merchant. Pull Temporal Distortion out of the Market. Grab the power and influence you need to play it. Start drawing cards until you find a Win Condition (Pit of Lenekta, Sword of the Sky King, The Great Parliament). Most Control decks tend to play a bit slow, and this deck is no different - I've drawn two-thirds of my deck in a game before. I try to mulligan for a Merchant and a Hailstorm, with Temple Scribe being a nice bonus. Otherwise, you just want to hit your influence requirements (double Primal early for sure, double Time by the mid-game and triple Time for Pit, and double Justice by the mid-game and quad Justice for Chains).\n\nWin Conditions\nMartyr's Chains: The least necessary of the deck's Win Conditions. Chains can be used to keep the AI's board clear, but it's main purpose is to end the game quickly in combination with Pit or Great Parliament. It can be marketed away if it feels like you don't need it for the game.\n\nPit of Lenekta: Pit allows you to be a little aggressive using your Owls on defense while also offering some life gain. The nice thing about Pit is that the AI will do everything it can to remove the tokens, but they just. keep. coming. Feel free to market it away if it is drawn early - sometimes Great Parliament is all that is needed to finish the game.\n\nSword of the Sky King: The finisher of choice in Justice-based Control decks since the very beginning. There are 3 copies in the deck, so it's very easy to market one copy away or place one on the bottom of the deck with Strategize.\n\nThe Great Parliament: The main win condition of the deck. Parliament works really well with Temporal, allowing you to snap play flying blockers if you need them, or sneak them in without giving the AI a chance to remove them. I try to hold off on playing Parliament until there is 8 power in play, but sometimes I will play a copy for a single token if necessary. These can also be marketed away early.\n\nCard Draw\nBrilliant Idea: It's really easy to draw massive amounts of cards in the late-game with Idea. I've used it on multiple occasions to draw 10 cards. It's purpose is to reload in the late game and find a Win Condition if you're still looking for one.\n\nCall for Aid: I really like this card in Temporal, but it's also been the one card that I've played around with the most. I started with 4 copies, but it can be awkward early if multiple copies are drawn. So I cut it down to 3 copies and ran 2 copies of Honor of Claws while cutting a single copy of Sword. I found this arrangement to be too clunky as a huge chunk of the card draw was suddenly 4 power or more. I cut Honor, went back to 3 copies of Sword, but kept Call for Aid at 3 copies and added another copy of Temple Scribe. At first glance, this card maybe doesn't look special, but having a Power Stone / Temple Scribe combo card is really helpful in a deck with a lot of design options.\n\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nTemple Scribe: Card draw and life gain attached to a chump blocker. This card has helped out so much in this deck that I added a 4th copy. Since it dies to Hailstorm anyway, if I have to choose, I'll go for double Time influence first to play Scribe, and then work on getting the double Primal for Hailstorm.\n\nOther Choices: Channel the Tempest, Honor of Claws, Vital Arcana, Wisdom of the Elders\n\nFixing\nPetition: There are only 7 sigils in the deck, so I went with Petition over Seek Power. With the key removal each needing double sources of their respective influence, grabbing Crests out of the deck is so valuable.\n\nSecret Pages: While they can help ramp a little early, once Pit or Chains is on the board, Secret Pages turns into a bit of a combat trick. Creating wurm tokens at the end of the AI's turn or enticing an attack and then removing a key AI unit to blow up the AI's board with blocks is really nice. Playing a power with Secret Pages doesn't count towards your 1 power per turn limit either, which can help squeeze out another Owl token.\n\nOther Choices: Seek Power, Trail Maker\n\nMarket\nAuralian Merchant and Great Valley Smuggler: 8 merchants to make sure you can pull Temporal out of the Market. The ramp from Auralian is nice as well. I feel like this deck will benefit a bit when the Combrei smuggler is released with Set 6.\n\nOther Choices: Jennev Merchant, Winchest Merchant\n\nUnit Removal\nHailstorm: The key to surviving the early game. I always try to have one in my opening hand if I can.\n\nHarsh Rule: Eternal's easy button. Push it when you need it.\n\nVanquish: I originally had Defiance in this spot, but the addition of Temple Scribe to the deck meant a little less pressure in the early game, and Defiance doesn't do a whole lot late. Vanquish has felt a lot better in this spot.\n\nOther Choices: Defiance, Desert Marshal, Equivocate, Permafrost\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 40 (25 power, 4 Auralian Merchant, 3 Call for Aid, 4 Petition and 4 Secret Pages)\nInfluence: 22 Time sources, 23 Justice sources, 22 Primal sources (counting Diplomatic Seal, Petition, and Secret Pages as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want.\n\nThat being said, don't sleep on Etched Monolith. Being able to heal back up to 25 HP usually means game over."

        "success": "I tend to build my Midrange Gauntlet decks using a very linear shell: 8 1- or 2-Drops, 8 3-Drops, 8 4-Drops, 4 5-Drops, 4 6-Drops, and 4 each of Card Draw, Fixing, Market and Unit Removal, with the remainder of the deck filled with whatever I think the deck can use. With that in mind, I thought I would go over the card choices here:\n\n2-Drops\nAwakened Student and Stormtamer Operative: It's hard to beat Student when it comes to 2-Drops. If not answered early, it can get pretty big, and it's a very nice target for Sword of Unity. Stormtamer Operative is one of those cards that takes advantage of a blind spot with the AI: It doesn't take it's ability into account before using removal. It will continually try and Torch 3-health units. It will continually try to ping 1-health units with Temper and Vara's Favor. It's ridiculous the amount of work Operative does just by sitting on the board.\n\nOther Choices: Dusk Raider, Kothon, the Far-Watcher, Resolute Monk\n\n3-Drops\nFalse Prince and Knight-Chancellor Siraf: False Prince is another blind spot for the AI: It will not target it with removal unless the removal does 5 or more damage. Sometimes the AI will get lucky with a Torch only because the initial plan was to use 2 Torches, but it still ends up Torching a frog, so it's a win in my book (The best is when the AI silences the Prince!). Siraf is a good early game unit, a good target for Killer or Sword of Unity, and can win games late thanks to her ability.\n\nOther Choices: Amaran Stinger, Auric Record Keeper, Hooru Pacifier, Icaria, Valkyrie Captain, Lunar Magus, Skycrag Scalebreaker, Teacher of Humility, Valkyrie Enforcer\n\n4-Drops\nSandstorm Titan and Shelterwing Rider: Titan is a no-brainer in a deck with only one flying unit. Take care with Titan against the heavy Flier decks - the AI will remove or silence it at first chance. Titan's immunity to Stun makes the Stun-heavy AI decks a lot easier (although be careful of Rebuke). Shelterwing Rider doesn't synergize with Titan very well, but it is a big unit that draws removal without killing it, and is the perfect target for Withstand from Korovyat Palace.\n\nOther Choices: Sheriff Marley, Svetya, Orene of Kosul\n\n5-Drops\nCirso, the Great Glutton and Marshal Ironthorn: Always happy to run Cirso - it's my favorite card in Eternal. A perfect target for Killer. Running Ironthorn without anything to ramp into may seem odd, but without much evasion, board stalls can be a reality. For those games where the AI is content to just sit there, Ironthorn offers a one-sided board clear. Ironthorn is actually the 6-Drop selection for the deck, as I didn't really love any of the other choices, so he certainly could be swapped out rather easily.\n\nOther Choices: Alhed, Mount Breaker, Eilyn, Clan Mother, Jotun Feast-Caller, Moonstone Vanguard, Serene Meditant, Svetya, Merciful Orene, Telut, Queen's Hand, The Great Parliament, Worldbearer Behemoth\n\nCard Draw\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nOther Choices: Ancient Lore, Call for Aid (I really like this card!), Temple Scribe\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: Most of my Midrange builds do not run 1-Drops because, for the most part, they are underwhelming. That leaves Seek Power as the best solution for Fixing, as it can give the deck something to do turn 1.\n\nOther Choices: Secret Pages, Trail Maker\n\nMarket\nGreat Valley Smuggler: Even without any Relics in the deck, this is a great option for the market due to her stats. Also the only merchant currently available to Time-Justice-Primal (can't they just leak the names of the other 5 tri-faction groupings?) that allows for both Sword of Unity and Korovyat Palace in the Market.\n\nOther Choices: Auralian Merchant, Jennev Merchant, Winchest Merchant\n\nMiscellaneous\nPetition: I generally don't like to run fewer than 30 power sources in a deck. There are also a few double influence combinations that can be difficult to grab. That said, these could be swapped out for just about anything else if you wanted.\n\nOther Choices: Infinite Hourglass, Mirror Image, Pit of Lenekta, Stand Together\n\nUnit Removal\nXenan Initiation: A great choice in any deck running Time stat sticks. Also makes Cirso extra gross. Just don't cast it on False Prince.\n\nOther Choices: Defiance, Desert Marshal, Equivocate, Martyr's Chains, Permafrost, Scorpion Wasp, Stormhalt Knife, Vanquish\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 31 (25 power, 2 Petition, 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 22 Time sources, 22 Justice sources, 16 Primals sources (counting Diplomatic Seal, Petition, and Seek Power as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

        "success": "I tend to build my Midrange Gauntlet decks using a very linear shell: 8 1- or 2-Drops, 8 3-Drops, 8 4-Drops, 4 5-Drops, 4 6-Drops, and 4 each of Card Draw, Fixing, Market and Unit Removal, with the remainder of the deck filled with whatever I think the deck can use. With that in mind, I thought I would go over the card choices here:\n\n2-Drops\nRipknife Assassin and Stormtamer Operative: Ripknife is a really flexible 2-Drop that can be used aggressively or defensively, and it doesn't feel too awful to draw later in the game. It's a toss-up if the AI dislikes Fliers or Deadly units more, and so it will sling removal at it, which brings up the other choice for the 2-Drop slot. Stormtamer Operative is one of those cards that takes advantage of a blind spot with the AI: It doesn't take it's ability into account before using removal. It will continually try and Torch 3-health units. It will continually try to ping 1-health units with Temper and Vara's Favor. It's ridiculous the amount of work Operative does just by sitting on the board. That being said, drawing it late isn't great, so there are only 3 copies in the deck.\n\nOther Choices: Blackhall Warleader, Dusk Raider, Kerendon Steward, Resolute Monk, Tavia, Lethrai Raidleader\n\n3-Drops\nAyan, the Abductor and False Prince: Ayan is another flexible unit that can be used to remove annoying early units, and the ultimate can be useful later in the game against removal heavy decks. False Prince is another blind spot for the AI: It will not target it with removal unless the removal does 5 or more damage. Sometimes the AI will get lucky with a Torch only because the initial plan was to use 2 Torches, but it still ends up Torching a frog, so it's a win in my book. (The best is when the AI silences the Prince!)\n\nOther Choices: Amaran Stinger, Auric Interrogator, Lunar Magus, Rhysta, Acantha's Herald, Skycrag Scalebreaker, Teacher of Humility\n\n4-Drops\nSandstorm Titan and Vara, Vengeance-Seeker: Two of the best, if not the best, 4-drops in the game. Take care with Titan against the heavy Flier decks - the AI will remove or silence it at first chance. Titan's immunity to Stun makes the Stun-heavy AI decks a lot easier (although be careful of Rebuke).\n\nOther Choices: Rindra, the Duskblade\n\n5-Drops\nMoonstone Vanguard: Possibly the best non-Smuggler Rare in Defiance (flip a coin between Vanguard and Hojan, Crownbreaker - both can be gross, in different ways). The AI will often attack into Vanguard thinking it has lethal, which can gain you enough life to not only stabilize, but go on the offensive. Another unit that can abuse the Stun-heavy AI deck strategy.\n\nOther Choices: Cirso, the Great Glutton (my favorite card in Eternal - swapping in Cirso requires adding some Killer to the deck, as Cirso with Killer is one of the grossest comobos in the game), Jotun Feast-Caller, Worldbearer Behemoth\n\n6-Drops\nBlack-Sky Harbinger: Not the most powerful 6-Drop available, but one that does a pretty decent job clearing board stalls while also gaining you some health. Harbinger wrecks the Grenadin decks, as well as a lot of the go-wide decks, and can help shore up the air defense in case Titan is a no-show. Probably the easiest card to swap out of the deck, though (which is why there are only 3 copies).\n\nOther Choices: Caiphus, Wandering King, Eilyn, the Rising Storm, any of the other choices from the 5-Drops\n\nCard Draw\nStrategize: My go-to for card draw in any Primal deck. The ability to get dead cards out of your hand is so good. I'm honestly surprised this card doesn't require double Primal influence.\n\nOther Choices: Call for Aid (I really like this card!), Cull the Deck, Dark Return, Temple Scribe\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: Most of my Midrange builds do not run 1-Drops because, for the most part, they are underwhelming. That leaves Seek Power as the best solution for Fixing, as it can give the deck something to do turn 1.\n\nOther Choices: Petition, Secret Pages, Trail Maker\n\nMarket\nGreat Valley Smuggler: Even without any Relics in the deck (although you can find them), this is a great option for the market due to her stats. Auralian Merchant can also grab all of the cards in my Market, however, if you value the ramp.\n\nOther Choices: Auralian Merchant, Ebon Dune Smuggler, Jennev Merchant, Kerendon Merchant\n\nMiscellaneous\nAuralian Cargo: The deck requires double Time and double Shadow fairly early (and double Primal if you want Cirso out of the Market), and Cargo helps out with that, while also contributing some extra draws once you find the influence you need. Even if the choices aren't great, the cards Cargo pulls are great choices for Market swaps.\n\nOther Choices: Mirror Image\n\nUnit Removal\nFeeding Time: My personal favorite among Eternal's removal options. Renders Dark Return and Stirring Sand strategies moot.\n\nOther Choices: Annihilate, Deathstrike, Desecrate, Display of Knowledge, Dizo's Office, Equivocate, In Cold Blood, Permafrost, Rindra's Choice, Scorpion Wasp\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 33 (25 power, 4 Auralian Cargo, 4 Seek Power)\nInfluence: 22 Time sources, 16 Primal sources, 20 Shadow sources (counting Auralian Cargo and Seek Power as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

Temporal Distortion is a great ramp card that allows you to play your ramp on your turn and Idea on theirs.\n\nTorgov's Trading Post was put in for the fun Arcanum Hourglass ramp combo. The large amounts of card draw allow you to find the Titans from Call the Ancients and Torgov frequently appears if you play it on 2 against a deck without 2 drops. The power discards are also extremely helpful in preventing your hand from getting clogged with power after casting Brilliant Idea.\n\nThis deck is not great but I find it amusing. I've managed to play Pit after only playing three power cards."

        "success": "I tend to build my Midrange Gauntlet decks using a very linear shell: 8 1- or 2-Drops, 8 3-Drops, 8 4-Drops, 4 5-Drops, 4 6-Drops, and 4 each of Card Draw, Fixing, Market and Unit Removal, with the remainder of the deck filled with whatever I think the deck can use. With that in mind, I thought I would go over the card choices here:\n\n2-Drops\nBlackhall Warleader and Ripknife Assassin: At the very worst, both of these units will draw a Torch out of the AI. If Warleader hits face even just once, the snowball effect is ridiculous. Ripknife is just a really solid 2-Drop that can be used aggressively or defensively, and it doesn't feel too awful to draw later in the game.\n\nOther Choices: Fenris Nightshade, Hojan, Crownbreaker (only one trigger for his Renown), Kerendon Steward, Tavia, Lethrai Raidleader\n\n3-Drops\nRhysta, Acantha's Herald and Valkyrie Enforcer: Rhysta is here to help with fixing while also providing an aggressive early-game unit. I wasn't sold on her due to her inability to block, but I definitely see her value now. I like her here a lot better than something like Vara's Favor. Enforcer is the best Justice 3-Drop, and it's not really close. I never feel bad playing Enforcer on curve without any targets for the ability.\n\nOther Choices: Auric Interrogator, Icaria, Valkyrie Captain (Similar to Rhysta but I like Rhysta better because the AI goes out of its way to remove Icaria before her ability can be activated)\n\n4-Drops\nVara, Vengeance-Seeker: Vara is an easy pick. The AI almost always sacrifices a unit to keep Vara small, which can get rid of some really annoying units. Unfortunately, the best Justice 4-Drop is Sheriff Marley, which doesn't work very well with Vara. I initially had Impending Doom in the deck, but Rhysta into Impending Doom ended up being a good way to get steamrolled by the AI. Without any other really decent choices, I opted to make a change to the shell instead (see Miscellaneous below).\n\nOther Choices: Crownwatch Traitor, Howling Kurtarr, Impending Doom\n\n5-Drops\nInquisitor Makto: Another easy choice. If Makto can avoid silence (or Feeding Time), it's usually game over. The AI will do everything it can to remove Makto, and doesn\u2019t mind tossing multiple removal spells at him. Just a huge value generator.\n\nOther Choices: Amilli, Cloudmarshal, Marshal Ironthorn, Tavrod, Auric Broker\n\n6-Drops\nCaiphus, Wandering King: Just the best big unit choice in Argenport. The lack of influence requirements is a plus, and sometimes the RNG rolls are just gross (Deadly, Overwhelm, and Quickdraw? OK!).\n\nOther Choices: Grinva, Judge of Battles, Svetya, Merciful Orene (only two Justice units in the deck), Zelia, the Vain (she does have synergy with Ripknife Assasin, but tends to be a little too slow)\n\nCard Draw\nCull the Deck: The best choice in a faction pairing that doesn't have a lot of options. An argument can be made for Dark Return. Reanimating either Vara or Caiphus is huge value (and potentially game-winning when it comes to Caiphus). Ultimately, I chose the option that is a little more flexible that also helps find the Maktos with Destiny.\n\nOther Choices: Dark Return, Devour\n\nFixing\nSeek Power: Most of my Midrange builds do not run 1-Drops because, for the most part, they are underwhelming. That leaves Seek Power as the best solution for Fixing, as it can give the deck something to do turn 1.\n\nOther Choices: Copperhall Bracers, Lost Scroll, Petition (not enough non-Sigil power to excuse the extra cost), Privilege of Rank, Vara's Favor\n\nMarket\nHidden Road Smuggler: Both mono-color Merchants in Argenport are rather underwhelming units, so I sacrificed a little bit of consistency for a better unit. The only other real option is Kerendon Merchant, because I like something in my markets to deal with Relics, and Justice doesn't have any options in that area.\n\nOther Choices: Kerendon Merchant, Winchest Merchant\n\nMiscellaneous\nThese cards are here to help the deck out, but they're not vital to the success of the deck, so there are only 3 copies of each.\n\nRegent's Tomb: This is played strictly for Lingering Influence, so that you can guarantee the 5th power for Makto. Swear Vengeance is nice on a lot of the units, but not vital, and a bit of a waste if Makto is the only unit on the board when it resolves. Sabotage is a bit of a dud in Gauntlet. The AI does not hold spells, and the card tends to miss more often than not unless it's played very early. I'm never really happy to play the card in Gauntlet. Elias is a nice bonus, but nothing I go out of my way to protect the site for, and the passive ability is OK here, but nothing special. Absorbing an attack from the AI is a nice perk, however.\n\nSuffocate: It might seem weird to see these here instead of something like Annihilate or Desecrate, but they are here for one reason: to open up the board in the early game to allow Blackhall Warleader to hit the AI. One or two hits from a Warleader is enough to snowball any match out of control. They can be placed in the Market later in the game if needed.\n\nOther Choices: Bloodletter, Dark Return, Devour, Madness\n\nUnit Removal\nSlay: As vanilla as unit removal gets, but the best choice as well. The only other removal I would consider here is Desecrate, which is really good, but the extra cost in both influence and health total isn't worth 1 power, in my opinion.\n\nOther Choices: Annihilate, Auric Runehammer, Deathstrike, Defiance, Desecrate, Vanquish\n\nPower[/p]\nPower Sources: 36 (25 power, 4 Seek Power, 4 Rhysta, 3 Regent's Tomb)\nInfluence: 24 sources of each color (counting Seek Power as a source for each color)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

You must understand the right time to summon units (because you don't want they die to Torch), the right time to block, the right time to attack, the right time to use spells, the right time to play powers, etc. This deck is NOT for begginers. If you begin the game few days ago use ANOTHER deck. Yes, this deck has \"no removal\" other than Torch. Battle Trick sometimes can look as a removal against the AI anyways.\n\nThe main weakness of the AI is battle tricks and this deck have alot. Alot of times you can OTK the opp. You can attack with Rilgon Disciple and he dont block then you use 4 spells and win.\n\nCard Choices:\n\nUnits:\n\nSoftfoot Burglar: This card is a machine. Perfect to combo with Plunder.\nRilgon's Disciple: Having 3 health means opp sometimes will not block with 2 health units and can easy OTK.\nFevered Scout: Trash in constructed, but a boss in gauntlet. +2/+2 for each spell combo with Trample is perfect to win.\nKosul Battlemage: Aegis is great against the AI. Thei love to try break the aegis instead of kill another units.\nGeomar: I only have 3 copies, but i think is enough in this deck. His main Weakness is summon in turn 4 because opp can Torch or Suffocate it.\nRizahn: Even after nerf he still great in this deck. Plunder and Xo make alot of spells to easy give lifesteal to it\nXo: Create alot of spells to trigger our units.\n\nSpells:\nPlunder: Help to trigger multiple units per turn and draw cards.\nPrivilege of Rank: Help to combo out. You need some mana to OTK.\n\nFast Spells:\nBottoms Up: AI is not ready to face this card. Is so powerfull.\nFinest Hour: For an unknown reason Giant Growth is trash in mtg, but great in Eternal.\nSharpened Reflex: Scout is great, also is a great surprise card. Use it more in Geomar, Kosul or Burglar.\nTorch: Best card in eternal.\nRampage: + 3 attack and trample is great. Only 1 more health is a problem. You must learn the right time to use it.\nReinvigorate: Ambush attack, x Permafrost and perfect with double damage. Remember to use spell that give Trample and/or Lifesteal first, then use Reinvigorate for more bonus."

Ramp into your big minions to out tempo the opponent and win by sheer force. Get Alhed from the market asap and just let him sit out to buff draws. Don't overextend against removal pile decks, playing one big minion each turn on curve is enough pressure to win, you are running near 50 creatures thanks to Amber Monument. Don't be afraid to use your Xenan Initiations to maintain tempo, the best targets for them are the Dawnwalkers (it sticks), a deadly Scorpion for a one shot, or on a Worldbearer/Moonstone to trigger their abilities.\n\nIf you need some graveyard hate you can throw Lumen Reclaimer in the market."

        "success": "Now with Primal's Sandstorm Titan!\n\nCopy Ruckus Rouser 2+ times, play a huge Clutch of Talons, fill the board with dragons, merchant for Kaleb's Choice with the 8 power generated from Clutch or play a Xo of the Endless Hoard if you're not worried about sweepers.\n\nThe deck also has a Plan B in beating down with 4-cost 6/8 Half-Overwhelm Half-Aegis Ambush units. Yes, Primal has found its very own rival to Sandstorm Titan and Vara, Vengeance-Seeker in playing one of your myriad copy effects on Glacier Shaper. Shaper provides a solid blocker vs aggro by itself, but when you get to ambush in a 6 Attack and 8 Health mixture of Ice Beast and Shaman with a Sudden Schism... kisses fingers.\n\nMass Entomancy targeting an active Rouser along with other units can double your power, setting up a lethal Flame Blast or massive Clutch. Bottoms Up serves a similar role and can act as a finisher with Ixtun Merchant's or a Glacial Monstrosity's Overwhelm, a Humbug, or a Screamed Rouser. Entomancy also has utility as a bad removal spell to deal with Sandstorm Titan, Telut, Queen's Hand, or any other unit preventing your dragons from closing the game. Flame Blast can also be pointed at an active Rouser to set up larger Clutches or a Bottoms Up.\n\nHaunting Scream lets you play out a Rouser on 4 without concern for its safety. If it gets killed you can scream it back to go for the combo on 5 power if you have a Mirror Image or on 6 power with Sudden Schism or Clutchmate. You're in trouble if Rouser gets silenced or transformed, so use caution around Valkyrie Enforcer, Statuary Maiden, and Feeding Time. You can also Scream a Merchant at the end of the combo to grab Clutch, Blast, Choice, or even Skycrag Banner if you need the 3rd Primal or 3rd Fire influence for the wincon in-hand. Regardless of their size, Glacial Monstrosities cost 3-power and can be screamed, so making a monstrous monstrosity with Bottoms Up or Entomancy and screaming+copying can be a nice line to finish games.\n\nWhile the deck is very fun to play and most games feel close, I still haven't found a build that can sustain a 50% win rate, so don't play this if you want to climb the ladder. Unfortunately, the deck's win rate will drop further if it gains popularity and opponents learn to make better market decisions and stop wasting fast speed removal on Merchants.\n\nMy basic redraw advice would be to redraw any hand that doesn't have a 3-drop and access to a Rouser. I would also keep Rouserless hands with a Shaper, a copy effect, a second unit and 3 power. Go for PPP before FFF when playing Seek Power since the Flame Blast kill is much harder to pull off than a sizable Clutch. Haunting Scream is your only Shadow card, so it is often correct to seek for your second (sometimes even third) Primal or Fire influence before your first Shadow influence.\n\nAgainst aggro you need to play turn 3 Merchant into turn 4 Rouser and pray they waste their torch on the merchant or turn 3 Glacier Shaper into a copy effect on turn 4. If you can't play a unit on 3, you might be forced to block with your Rouser to survive, and that spells doom unless you have the Scream/Mirror Image immediate follow up.\n\nThe deck matches up decently with other removal-light combo decks like Chainbrei and Talir/Voda. Both decks can have access to Desert Marshal, which will mess you up, but, when undisrupted, I believe this deck goes off on turn 5 more consistently. Telut and/or Sword of Unity plus Icaria, Valkyrie Captain gives Chainbrei an out to a large Clutch, but Entomancy can help you fight through.\n\nAgainst Harsh Rule control decks, pressure with Merchants and Shapers when you can and take your time to set up a large Clutch with Kaleb's Choice up or try for the Flame Blast kill before Cobalt Waystone comes online. Against Regent's Tomb decks it can be smart to hold a merchant until the combo turn to avoid getting your Clutch, Blast, or Choice sabotaged. Playing a smaller Clutch to pressure and bait out a Rule can be better than emptying your hand to play the max number of dragons if you can't protect them.\n\nIf you suspect the opponent is holding up Torch or Annihilate and you're not under immense pressure, merchant for Kaleb's Choice before going for the Ruckus combo. You get the power from Rouser's trigger immediately after casting a copy effect, so you'll have the power to cast Choice when your opponent tries to kill your Rouser in response to the copy spell. If you have to go for the combo into an opponent holding up fast removal like Equivocate, play your most expensive copy effect first as you still get the power from the Rouser trigger. Clutch at 8-12 power can still win the game or stall it out long enough for a second try at the big combo. It can even be correct to lead off with Flame Blasting or Humbugging your Rouser if your opponent's fast removal is face-up. Any copy effects left in hand are good at making additional dragons or \"Snowstorm Titans\" post-Clutch.\n\nEnd of Hostilities is usually just a Mirror Image with Warp that gives you +6 power with Rouser as the deck has no tribute enablers, but keep an eye out for any lines where suiciding a merchant or spent Rouser enables a double copy on the best unit on the board. Flame Blasting your Rouser activates tribute and can generate the power to do things like play Xo and immediately double copy it. The deck only has 2 copies of EoH because a hand with two EoH goes off 2 turns slower than a hand with any other copy effect and a single EoH, but the extra 2 power can really matter when trying for the Flame Blast kill.\n\nIf the combo pieces don't come together, sometimes you can buy time by casting 6-power Clutches on Jennev Merchant. If your hand lacks Clutch or a lethal Flame Blast, you can try to get there with a 10-power Xo+Mirror Image Xo turn.\n\nThe card cost increase from Amplify works differently for spells and weapons. Amplified spells increase in effective cost, so Mass Entomancy on Rouser can double your power, whereas amplified weapons do not increase in effective cost, so Clutch of Talons only ever gives 8 power when triggering Rouser or a 4/4 monstrosity when attached to a Shaper. DWD has confirmed that these disparate Amplify interactions between card types are intended and not a bug.\n\nProps to Almost's WWH combo decks for the inspiration to include Haunting Scream.\n\nThis deck is one Clutchkeeper short of being clutch tribal.\n\nGame's over boys."

        "success": "Small disclaimer: I don't play Ranked, I'm a total casual and I usually only play Gauntlet. That being said, I've had a lot of fun with this janky deck, even in Versus, so I thought I'd post it. Suggestions to improve appreciated :D\n\nSo I've named the deck Death By Inches. The idea is to ping your opponent to death with small amounts of damage. So far not so original, I guess. The way I do it is by combining lots and lots of Grenadin with the Disassembler armed with a Hunter's Harpoon. Every time a Grenadin dies, the Disassembler pings the opponent, drawing you a card, allowing you to draw more Grenadin to send to their deaths, pinging the opponent with the Disassembler, drawing more cards, rinse and repeat.\n\nThere are some contingency plans, of course, in case the combo doesn't immediately materialize (or simply gets removed by the opponent). For more card draw you can always Devour your Grenadin (bonus if the Disassembler/Harpoon combo is out) or use Cauldron Cookbook.\n\nFor more pinging action, there's Ticking Grenadin, Tripwire Grenadin, Calderan Gunsmith, and Icicle Marksman. The latter also works with the Harpoon in a pinch as there are a decent amount of spells in the deck.\n\nSparkbot is an okay blocker and a way of getting another Grenadin on the board.\n\nIxtun Merchant is there to get your combo together.\n\nSignal Flare is probably an odd choice over Torch, but I like the scout effect.\n\nThe tactics of the deck consist of always pinging the opponent's face. I generally don't care about the board they're building as long as they're not able to Overwhelm or outnumber my units. I send my Grenadin to their deaths, one at a time, and hope they'll get stomped on by a bigger creature or hit the opponent's face, either is good. If the opponent attacks, I block with as many units as needed, always keeping the Disassember safe, and just crank out more of them.\n\nIt's too janky to be competitive but I do think this deck is a lot of fun to play :D\n\nThanks for reading!"

Having 4 of those and 4 copies of Display of Vision gives the deck a lot of flexibility, and DoV allows you to ramp early and in the lategame it's a Fast way to trigger Empower and potentially give you face-Aegis with Cobalt Waystone.\nI tried running Temporal Distortion too, but Martyr's Chains is better at finishing the game.\n\nA few things that aren't optimal and should probably be changed:\n* the manabase: having 18 crests and 7 waystones means that most power in the deck is depleted, which means the curve is delayed by one turn; influence requirements are also quite heavy (TTTJJJJPPPPSSS for everything, but the deck functions on TJJPPS when you aren't looking for finishers)\n* the Merchant-Market setup: having 8 merchants is nice, but not that useful since there's no must-have card in the market and all cards there are reactive (with the exception of Brilliant Idea, which works as a follow-up finisher once we have an Empower-relic in play, so it's \"reactive\" to your own plays)\n* some relics in the deck (Auric Runehammer, Eternity Core, Citywide Ban) are rarely tutored for\n* Channel the Tempest is a card I loved before the nerf, and I want to have it in the deck, but I very rarely find myself playing it\n\n\nI've had a suprisingly decent winrate with this deck in low-Gold (7W 7L, with 1-1 being turn1 concessions)."

        "success": "So this is my latest waste of shiftstone. I find it difficult to pilot but REALLY rewarding to win with. Your basic plan vs Aggro is to control them and win with card advantage. Against Midrange decks, dropping aegis threats and playing clutch with multiple Amps is the plan and vs Control you rain of frogs their strongest play (merchant, Vara, Grasp etc.) And win with Aegis.\nOpen to suggestions, I feel like there's a good deck here but it's not quite there yet. Sideboard is my current considerations for cards.\nEdit: chopped and changed a few things. The deck really only loses to bad draws against most matchups, but notable weaknesses are anything that dodges both hailstorm and vanquish (Statuatory Maiden[card], Lunar Magus etc) Crownwatch Standard is better than Hojan as we rarely need the lifesteal before turn 5 and it's fast and harder to predict. A hooru merchant would really help the deck and get it out of it's 1.5-2 tier standings atm.\nEdit: Runehammer is what the deck has been missing for those 4 health threats (maiden, Magus etc.) After some streamlining changes and putting in linebreakers shield (I haven't seen much Reanimator in masters) the deck wins most matchups that aren't fjs pile with maidens varas and riza-hns.\nEdits for metagame. Hurler provides snowball vs aggro and a body vs control so worthy inclusion. Banner in the market fixes influence and gets us to 4 power in a screw scenario.\nEdit for Homecoming. Deck consistently crushing most opponents thanks to palace and Big Svetya. Throne warden is a placeholder for Omen in the market atm.\nEdit: the previous version was riding on homecoming hype and poor decks in masters due to it, so I overhauled it and built this. A more midrange-oriented deck than controlling. The deck has come a long way from previous lists and is finally good imo. Probably going to edit it again soon when it bombs in an odd game though lol."

I am trying this list post Vargo/Harsh Rule meta because it plays primarily Aegis threats or Relic Weapons, all of which don't care too much about board wipes (except End of the Story). The biggest weakness of the deck currently is Tokens (which is kept in check by Vargo/Rule) and Site decks, hence the Casualties of the Cause in the market, slight non-bo if your Smuggler is the only unit you have, but when you gotta kill a Palace or a Peak, some collateral damage is necessary. My second biggest concern is that curve...*shudders* but not sure how to smooth that puppy out. Probably too many 8 drops, Sword is just a really good hit off Icaria and will always ice a bear where the other weapons won't post Palace.\n\nAny and all advice would be greatly appreciated."

        "success": "A budget dino deck built with synergy in mind. The main idea behind this deck is to play big dino units and give them killer to remove threats.\n- Predatory Carnosaur, Twilight Hunt and Striking Snake Formation kill the threats.\n- Fishing Dinoch gets bigger and bigger with Mirror Image and Clutchmate\n- Avisaur Patriarch decreases unit cost and also buffs them in late game\n- Serasaur Bull takes care of Permafrost, Avigraft and other enemy weapon/relic.\n- Twinning Ritual or Second Sight on Twinbrood Sauropod increases available units on play. So does Crested Runt with its amplify. It goes well with Savage Skybrood, which gets bigger with more dinosaurs coming into play.\n\nPossible improvements: This deck currently doesn't have any legendary. Ancient Terrazon can be a good fit. Also I am keeping the deck as much thematic as possible. That's the reason I haven't added any Merchant or Explorer. Both Auralian Merchant and Evelina, Valley Searcher will be an improvement to the deck, I believe. The only off-tribe unit in the deck is Amber Acolyte and I am thinking of replacing it with Seek Power."

Only kept track of the mu data of the last 55 games. For some of the most common mu I went 9-2 against Rakano Aggro, 8-1 against FJS, 3-0 Against Xenan, 2-2 against Skycrag Aggro, and 1-4 Against Feln Aggro/Scream/Berserk.\n\n-Update of the deck after the most recent patch that \"reverted\" Vara. 21-4 so far to close out day 2, if it keeps up I might grind for 50.\n\n-Updated for Homecoming. Experimenting with HoC, so far a very good card.\n-Testing out some changes, Aggro isn't as prevalent so I'm trying it out in the Market. Wardens are for some more units to help with Sites and buffing your relic weapons. Still want to find room for an Idea or two.11-6 with these changes so far.\n-Been running 8 merchants, decided to test out running 4 again.\n-Ran a mixture of Feln, JPS, and Hooru Control for the last leg of April to Masters with a record of 18-5."

        "success": "This deck started out as an attempt to build an Auralian Haunting Scream deck shortly after the release of Set 5 (Defiance) that tried to take advantage of Cykalis and Dread. It didn't work. Dread just never felt anything other than clunky. So, when I went to re-tool the deck, I noticed that the 4-Drop slot in Auralian had 3 REALLY good options, so I took the deck in a different direction, and this is the result. Lets take a look at the cards:\n\nDeck Strategy\nFairly straightforward for a Control deck: Try and stay above water removing the AI's board while searching for the pieces needed to apply pressure. I usually play the deck rather defensively until I can find a unit (I prefer Rindra first, then Vara, and try to save Cykalis for lethal) as well as some form of reanimation (if I can, I Scream first, and then Dark Return, as the unit will retain the Flying and Charge from the Scream). Removal from the AI actually helps the deck's strategy, Silence isn't very fun, while Steward of the Past and Reality Warden are jerks. As with most Control decks, the Mulligan is one of the biggest portions of any game played with the deck. Look for Fixing, Unit Removal, and possibly some Card Draw early on, and double Primal and double Shadow are the priority for the first few turns. If Time influence is elusive early on, it's not a game killer, as it's only needed for Cykalis and Banish.\n\nWin Conditions\nCykalis, the Burning Sand: The finisher in the deck. Since the AI spams it's removal, it never seems to have any hard removal left over for Cykalis. Cykalis and Mirror Image is fun, and Dark Return on Cykalis is great. I try not to use Cykalis as a target for Haunting Scream if I can help it, though.\n\nRindra, the Duskblade: If there is a choice, Rindra should be the first unit played. It will immediately draw a removal answer from the AI if it has one; the Nightfall means you draw a card at the very least; and Rindra is the best unit in the deck to use Haunting Scream on thanks to the Lifesteal. Playing Rindra and then following it up the next turn with a Haunting Scream and Mirror Image applies a lot of pressure while helping to stabilize your health total.\n\nVara, Vengeance-Seeker: If Cykalis and Rindra are the gas, Vara is the value. Any deck running Vara has to seriously consider using some form of reanimation because of her ability. Haunting Scream with Vara is just filthy, as the AI will sacrifice a unit to her ability if it can, even if it's a potential blocker. I've actually had the AI sacrifice Scorpion Wasp in response to Vara's ability, which is just silly. Getting rid of Aegis is the key to victory against a couple of the AI decks.\n\nCard Draw\nDark Return and Strategize: Pretty easy choices. Dark Return makes the deck go, and Strategize is best card draw option in most Primal decks.\n\nOther Choices: Call for Aid, Honor of Claws (This card might be good here, but the power cost makes me pause a little)\n\nFixing\nAuralian Cargo and Petition: Don't hesitate to use Cargo to pull power whenever you can, as you're very unlikely to find double Time influence very early and the cards it generates aren't as important as finding the Primal and Shadow influence the deck needs. Petition is the pick over Seek Power here to better help find Time influence when it's needed (2 Sigil sources of Time vs. 6 Crest sources of Time).\n\nMarket\nJennev Merchant and Kerendon Merchant: I usually only run 4 Merchants, but I went with 6 here because the Win Condition package of units, reanimation, and Mirror Image took up a little more room in the deck then is typically the case in my Control decks. 6 Merchants helps to grab a Scream when you need one while also giving access to more Unit Removal options.\n\nMiscellanous\nHaunting Scream: Again, if Dark Return is the value, Scream is the gas. I run 3 copies main with the other tucked away in the Market.\n\nMirror Image: No Eternal deck is complete without some sort of greed. Mirror Image isn't necessary in the deck, but it does lead to some fun burst damage. If you're not familiar with the interaction, using Mirror Image on a unit brought back from the void with Haunting Scream creates a copy of the unit with Charge and Flying, but the copy is not sacrificed at the end of your turn. Since it's pure greed, there are only 2 copies in the deck, and I really wouldn't want more than 3.\n\nUnit Removal\nAnnihilate: Pretty standard unit removal choice for Shadow. Instead of 4 copies of one or the other, I went with 2 copies each of Annihilate and Rindra's Choice. There are a couple of AI decks where Annihilate is always a dead card, and Rindra's Choice doesn't do anything against the mono-color AI decks. If it's a dead card, it's usually my first choice to Market away.\n\nBanish: A really flexible removal option. In addition to dealing with the always annoying (unless it's on your side of the board) Sandstorm Titan, it also gets rid of Xenan Obelisk. It also helps against the Armory and Sentinel AI matchups. I personally like to run 3 copies in the main and 1 in the Market.\n\nFeeding Time: The best hard removal option that doesn't have a drawback associated with it. In Cold Blood and Deathstrike are also very good, but Annihilate and Banish can sort of fill the same role as Deathstrike, while Feeding Time is better in more matchups than In Cold Blood. The cost can make it a little clunky, so only 2 copies in the main (I like 1 in the Market as well).\n\nHailstorm: The only defense against pure Aggro and go-wide strategies. I only play 3 copies total because the life gain from Rindra and Vara usually means that the deck can race if it needs to. There is an argument to be made that having 1 in the Market is wrong because only a single Merchant can grab it. It's possible swapping Hailstorm for something like Rindra makes the deck better.\n\nRindra's Choice: The yin to Annihilate's yang. Feel free to Market this card if the matchup renders it unplayable.\n\nOther Choices: Desecrate, Equivocate\n\nPower\nPower Sources: 33 (25 power, 4 Auralian Cargo, 4 Petition)\nInfluence: 16 Time sources, 25 Primal sources, 22 Shadow sources (counting Auralian Cargo and Petition as a source for each)\n\nMarket Choices\nI tend to build my Markets in a specific way (Win Condition, Unit Removal, Fixing, Relic Removal and a Wild Card spot). I never assume a Market for a deck is set in stone and neither should you - feel free to build it however you want."

This list is inspired by LightsOutAce's Kennadins list; however, I'm testing more maindeck Bore because the card is total gas right now with Ixtun Merchant. Assembly Line is my first cut as I have never really wanted to cast it as I've found Drone and Hatcher give enough dorks to tribute away to Cell.\n\nThe best line I have found so far which has almost always lead to a win is EoH a Merchant to grab Peak and Power. Then using Image on your Merchants to grab Molot and from there it is nearly impossible to lose with an active Peak, 3 3/3 overwhelm bodies and a Molot.\n\nEdit 1: -1 Assembly Line; +1 Wisdom of the Elders; Wisdom has in over 80% of my games been more impactful than Assembly Line. This is especially true now that one of the most powerful lines the deck can take doesn't really need Tribute active after the first EoH. My next testing question is: \"Is 4 Kenna correct? Merch -> Peak -> Molot has felt even more powerful lately than EoH -> Kenna\"\n\nEdit 2: This is just Kobi's list. Deck was total gas in the ECQ, currently I see no changes needed, except maybe bringing in the 4th Cell since we moved to a black Market post nerfs.\n\nEdit 3: Final edit for a while, I'm quite happy with this list, dropped an Assembly Line for the fourth Cell, running quite nice."

We have both, cards that are many for one and card advantage mechanism.\nWe utilize efficiency of Grenadins with sacrifice outlet of Shadow faction.\n\nUnits\n- 4 Grenadin Drone is a great example of 2 for 1 efficiency, it places 2 units on the battlefield, where unit count matters in this deck for multiple reasons.\n- 4 Dark Wisp card advantage and sacrifice for value target, it will be consumed by Ravenous Thornbeast to grow it scary or by Devour to draw 3 cards and gain some life, while chump-blocking opponent's threats.\n- 4 Flamefang Charmer another example of card advantage, coz by getting in you get another quite useful creature, more that that you \"draw\" it that does benefit from Warpainter.\n- 4 Obsidian Golem is another food for our sacrifice cards that can replace itself with same stats.\n- 4 Scrap Hound this is our early agro drop and big mid game threat, biggest from available.\n- 4 Ravenous Thornbeast another example of good midgame threat.\n- 4 Lethrai Instigator or repeatable buff effect for the crowd we have. Other benefit is 4 life, it dodges most of removal.\n\nSpells\n- 2 Combust one of the best removal in format, more than that it's unconditional removal.\n- 4 Torch reason Fire faction is most popular in this format. Pure efficiency.\n- 2 Into the Furnace that's our secret tech, coz most of removal hit for 3, but this one will hit for 4 and opponent wouldn't be prepared for that.\n- 2 Execute another example of removal, it's hard to use thou, coz you suppose to target exhausted creature, many think that you suppose to wait till creature will attack you, but you probably forget, that when creature blocks, it also exhausts. So attacking with bunch of 1/1s into some huge threats makes opponent relax and make mistakes.\n- 4 Devour card advantage and way to efficiently champ-block with our small creatures.\n- 4 Manufacture card advantage mechanism, generates pure value especially if you remember that it has Warp, so basically you can and should play it from top of your deck.\n- 4 Dark Return helps to return our big beaters like Ravenous Thornbeast or Scrap Hound.\n\nPretty sweet games i had and pack of removal really helps to break even boards.\n\nDon't forget to leave a like."

It makes this deck work against low to the ground decks and especially Grenadin Drone.\nFrost Talisman is game winning in the late game. Very similar to moondial.\nWormstone is very slow, but the wurm is quite hard to answer.\nInfused Guardian is a good bomb and pledge is great.\nNot sure what best damage spells are. Torch is obviously great. Lightning strike is also great, but does allow a warcry. Conflagrate seems better than purify since common units are simpler. Meteor gets 4 toughness units. Magma Javelin can attack players, but is otherwise worse than Meteor.\nTrailblaze adds consistency but I am not sure about it.\nArchive curator provides a silence, which is diminished but can hit Corrupted Umbren. It's a good blocker.\n\nSuggestions welcome"

Also, there is a Minotaur Tribal theme! Just remember that Runic Warhammer dies to [AuricInterrogator[/card]'s ability and to Nightfall. This is still a work in progress, mind you, and more of a fun deck than a laddering one.\n\nTake care,\nCalebovitsch"

A 7/0 Hideout Pistol is a monster slayer.\n\nNote:\n\u2022 Deck got me to Master in September and Oct. 2018\n\u2022 I originally ran with Rakano Sheriff but replaced her with Vara, V-S. I like R. Sheriff however, synergizes well with R. Vigilante and Tavrod, as well as providing another unit for Hideout Pistol, however Vara is also extremely powerful, often serving as removal, and synergizes with the deadly theme of this deck as well.\n\u2022 Rolants Favor replaced a 2 drop unit slot, originally ran with Battlefield Scavenger.\n\u2022 For a more aggressive build, you could switch Rolants Favor with 4 Lethrai Target Callers, remove one Seek Power. Target Caller is more viable now, being a 3/2 and synergizes well with Deadly, still testing because 3 Seek Power may be too little due to the high influence several cards.\n\u2022 Dueling Pistols can be replaced with Bloodletter for more health."

        "success": "A fun little deck that combines some of my personal favourite cards in the game: Chalice, Crown and Hero of the People.\n\nChalice and Moondial are your main draw engines here as usual.\nYou draw the Hero and play it with some cheap creatures with essential skills like Aegis, Flying, Endurance and Lifesteal.\nDon't forget to buff your Hero with Chalice BEFORE you play other creatures next to it. If it goes above 2 strength with skills, you can't buff it with Chalice anymore.\n\nIf you enter the late game, you will be relying on Crown to keep the pressure on your opponent with small but dangerous creatures, or simply chump block with them until you draw something game-ending like Double Damage, Echo or Destiny.\n\nBorderlands Waykeeper is slightly better than Silverwing Familiar or Crownwatch Paladin for Aegis imo because it is such a good aggro blocker. Plus you need some Primal creatures. There's too many Justice creatures in this deck as is.\n\nShelterwing Rider can be a big blocker and attacker with Aegis, but can also be buffed with Chalice when it loses its Aegis.\n\nMarket: Lumen Reclaimer is a minor insurance policy in case the game goes on for too long. But you probably won't need it. Passage of Eons was surprisingly helpful against Revenge and weapon decks (although it's probably too expensive to play against hyper aggro Rakano decks). Cirso's Choice protects you from relic destruction and it's the only damaging spell that can be drawn with Auralian Merchant, in case your opponent plays a bunch of Grenadins.\n\nThis deck is far from perfect and it needs some work. So please leave a comment with suggestions!"

        "success": "Here's a version of Cheap Bait - Which I'm now calling Meme Scream, I guess? This is the version I'm having the most fun with right now. I had to cut Crimson Firemaw, because he was always eating removal on play and never got his effect to go off.\n\nThe deck wants to keep a Stoneshaker in the opening hand, if possible, because that brings a lot of your power minions down to flashpoints. Gorgon Fanatic can be brought back with Dredger afterwards, and Bait becomes Screamable. Once you hit two of the Stoneshakers, you become able to scream Caiphus, which is *Chef Kiss.*\n\nEDIT: It was getting hard in the current meta to recycle Pyroknight's Ult, so I switched it with Lifespeaker. Lifespeaker also helps Caiphus gain skills, which reduces a bit of the randomness he presents. Also added a couple of Quarry for more reliable draw / added cost reduction."

        "success": "#Description (!whatis Unstable Rush):\nUnstable Rush is a meme deck that has somehow managed to achieve measurable amounts of success while also being totally ridiculous. The player's goal is to cheat out North-Wind Herald, Sindok, Rage Incarnate, or Lurking Sanguar. The turn after, the power cost of each resets back to normal. At this point, the player can play Unstable Form to upgrade the unit to a better one that wouldn't normally be achievable that early in the game. The backup plan is basically Skycrag beatdown with a go wide strategy of 4 strength charge units... For more info, ask ScoreWin\n\n#Gotchas:\n- The Power Cost of a Conditionally Free Unit will remain 0 until the end of turn. Wait to play Unstable Form until the following turn or you will end up with a Random 1 Power Unit.\n- North-Wind Herald will take into account the Unstable Form that targets it. Make sure that Unstable Form is the first spell used that turn and that you do not Unstable Form more than one North-Wind Herald a turn.\n\n#Market Strategy:\n- Watch the Market in action!\n- Trail Stories can be fetched and immediately played on another 1 cast spell... which is then played... which triggers North-Wind Herald free activation. Total Power Cost: 3\n- Sindok, Rage Incarnate can be fetched and played the same turn if enough damage has been dealt.\n- Warhelm can be fetched to allow Ixtun Merchant to immediately attack for 4 damage.\n- Bore can be fetched to free any units bound by Permafrost. NOTE: You can cast Bore repeatedly to activate North-Wind Herald.\n- Stonescar Banner can be fetched as a fail-safe to play any Lurking Sanguars in hand.\n\n#Screenshots:"
