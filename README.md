# eternalCardEvaluator
Gathers play rates of Eternal cards in recent tournament decks.

Not yet portable, and requires installation of python and packages.

Output file is called "Test" which is very misleading.

Replace contents of collection.txt with your collection export, and run main.py.

Uncomment update lines in main to rediscover decks and cards (after an update, for example).
Old decks are currently not culled from the list, so manually set the contents of decks.json to "[]" to do so.
