##Cards

#### Why are cards showing up more than once?

The red colored diamond above the card shows the copy of the card being shown.

Each of the 4 copies of a card can have a different value. A market card might have a 
very desirable first copy, and unplayed 2nd, 3rd and 4th copies.

#### What is popularity?
Card popularity is how desirable a copy of card is to own.

It is calculated from the card's use in
 [Eternal Warcry decks](https://eternalwarcry.com/decks),
 with focus on more recent and more popular decks.
 
 
#### What is craft efficiency?
Craft efficiency is how much you should craft a card with shiftstone.

Mostly that means dividing popularity / cost, but it is also better to craft cards that 
you are less likely to find naturally while playing the game. Easily findable cards, 
like Common cards from the latest set, have lower craft efficiency.
